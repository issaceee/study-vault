## What is Literature?  
### Oxford Prelims Paper 1B / Paper 3 Core Lecture  

---

## Introduction: The Question that Refuses an Answer  

Few questions in literary study are more persistent — or more productive — than “What is literature?” Every attempt to define it seems to dissolve into new questions about language, value, imagination, and power. As the lecturer remarks, “It’s hard to imagine a definition of literature that wouldn’t find room for *To be or not to be.* But why?”:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  

This lecture moves from Shakespeare to Wordsworth, from Beckett to William Carlos Williams, to show how definitions of literature are themselves acts of criticism — each definition is also a kind of reading.

> **Mini-Essay — The Question of Literature**
>
> To ask “what is literature?” is to perform a literary act: to interpret, to weigh form and meaning, to create connections between texts. The category “literature” is not fixed; it is the record of how cultures imagine the power and limits of language itself.

---

## I. Hamlet and the Problem of Definition  

The lecture begins, fittingly, with *Hamlet*’s “To be or not to be,” a speech so famous it defines literature even as it resists definition. Why do we read this soliloquy as literature, rather than as “the theatrical equivalent of a teenager howling, ‘God, I wish I was dead’”?:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

Possible answers:  

- **Form:** iambic pentameter that “topples over” with extra syllables — a pattern of control and loss.  
- **Patterning and Repetition:** the play’s obsession with questioning (“question it, Horatio”).  
- **Cultural Longevity:** its echo through later works — Eliot’s *Prufrock*, cartoons, film, even advertising.  
- **Ethical Reflection:** Hamlet’s “or” models balance and tolerance — a miniature of moral deliberation.  
- **Language as Renewal:** “sea of troubles” was a cliché, yet Shakespeare “rinses it clean.”  

Each feature is plausible, yet none singly defines literature. As the lecture notes, *Hamlet*’s artistry depends not on one property, but on the **family resemblance** among many.

> **Mini-Essay — The Ethics of Ambiguity**  
> Hamlet’s soliloquy enacts literature’s defining gesture: to pose a problem without resolving it. Its rhythm of questioning — “to be or not to be” — becomes a structure of ethical imagination. The undecidable “or” marks literature’s refusal of certainty, its balance between action and reflection.

## II. Aesthetic Form and Ethical Value  

### Literature and the Moral Imagination  

From the Romantics to modern critics such as Martha Nussbaum, literature has been celebrated as a **training ground for empathy**. Reading fiction “allows us to feel our way into the lives of others.” George Eliot’s *Middlemarch* does not merely *depict* society; it asks us to *recreate* it imaginatively.  

Yet the lecture warns against sentimental assumptions: aesthetically fine books do not automatically produce moral readers. Stalin, after all, annotated hundreds of books daily, scrawling “rubbish” or “haha” in the margins. “A reader who failed to see that it wasn’t only when opening a work of fiction he held other people’s lives in his hands”:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.  

> **Mini-Essay — Reading and Responsibility**  
> Literature exercises empathy, but it does not guarantee virtue. The reader’s ethical test is not emotional sympathy but interpretive attention — the willingness to recognise language as action, not ornament.

---

## III. Making It New: Literature as Renewal  

Ezra Pound’s dictum “Make it new” describes literature’s task as linguistic resurrection. Samuel Beckett’s *How It Is* (“that’s not said any more it must have ceased to be of interest”) performs this renewal by breaking syntax to rediscover speech. Yet, as the lecture wryly notes, renewal is also what headlines and football chants do: “Super Caley go ballistic Celtic are atrocious.”  

Thus, form alone cannot define literature; novelty can appear in the most banal places. The power of *Hamlet* or Beckett lies not simply in originality but in the way **form reawakens thought**.

---

## IV. What the Dictionaries Don’t Tell Us  

The Oxford English Dictionary’s entry for *literature* lists everything from “the realm of letters” to “written work valued for superior or lasting artistic merit.” This breadth exposes the problem: to define literature is to **draw boundaries around a moving target**.  

### Terry Eagleton and Family Resemblance  

In *The Event of Literature* (2012), Eagleton argues that literary definition works less by strict criteria than by *family resemblances* — a concept from Wittgenstein. Works may share traits (fictionality, formal pattern, imaginative depth), yet none is necessary or sufficient on its own.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Family of Words**  
> Literature resembles a family portrait: no single feature defines kinship, but resemblance appears across generations. As with families, resemblance also includes rivalry — a constant rewriting of lineage.

Raymond Williams traced the word’s shifting meaning:  
- **14th century:** “polite learning” — literacy as social polish.  
- **Renaissance:** shared knowledge — Bacon’s “erudition, divine and humane.”  
- **Romantics:** creativity and imagination — the “secondary world.”  
By the 19th century, literature meant **imaginative writing**; by the 21st, it risks meaning **everything**.

---

## V. Literature and Power: Canon, Culture, and Critique  

### From De Quincey to the Canon Wars  

Thomas De Quincey distinguished “the literature of knowledge” (newspapers, reports) from “the literature of power” (Milton, Shakespeare). Later critics — Arnold, Leavis — saw literature as moral education. But postmodern critics argue that *“literature” is an evaluative label*, used to legitimise cultural hierarchies.  

Roland Barthes’s provocation (1969): *“Literature is what gets taught.”*  

### Canon Debates  
The 1980s “canon wars” questioned whose experience literature represents. Should “great books” courses, filled with “dead white European males,” represent the diversity of living readers?  

Frank Kermode’s *History and Value* (1988) offered a conciliatory view: the canon is “cultural memory,” capable of expansion without destruction.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Politics of Inclusion**  
> Every canon is a mirror: it reflects not only what a culture values but what it excludes. Expanding the canon is not about replacing works but rethinking the principles of inheritance.

---

## VI. Language, Use, and the Literary Function  

Does literature use language in a “special” way? The lecture suggests two answers.  

### 1. **Defamiliarisation** — The Russian Formalists  
Viktor Shklovsky’s 1917 essay “Art as Technique” argued that art makes the familiar strange: it “defamiliarises” the world, forcing us to see anew. William Carlos Williams’s *This Is Just to Say* performs this by turning a domestic note into a poem — an act of everyday estrangement.  

### 2. **Interpretive Communities** — Stanley Fish  
Fish’s famous classroom experiment (*Is There a Text in This Class?*, 1980) revealed that meaning depends not on textual properties but on **the expectations of readers**. A list of names becomes a “religious poem” once readers believe it is one.  

> **Mini-Essay — Literature as Agreement**  
> Literature is not a property of language but of *attention*. The literary arises when readers choose to read as if something were literature. The poem, the play, the shopping list — all depend on the interpretive act.

---

## VII. The Boundaries of Literature: From Kipling to Culture  

Rudyard **Kipling’s** imperial poem “The Burial” (1902) memorialises Cecil Rhodes as a conquering spirit whose “soul shall be her soul.” Should it remain in the canon? Walter Benjamin’s dictum — “There is no document of civilisation which is not at the same time a document of barbarism” — warns that aesthetic monuments are also political ones.  

Christopher Ricks offers a subtler solution: later writers decide which predecessors survive, by rewriting or refuting them. T. S. Eliot’s modernism keeps the metaphysical poets alive precisely by transforming them.  

Thus, literature is not a static inheritance but a **conversation across time** — a sequence of reanimations.

---

## VIII. Work and Play: Two Modes of Literature  

Drawing on Seamus Heaney’s *The Redress of Poetry*, the lecture concludes with a twin model.  

### 1. Literature as Work  
Literature **does things**: it acts, persuades, and reshapes ideology. Like a delayed “speech act,” it changes the world indirectly — *Uncle Tom’s Cabin* inspiring abolition, Goethe’s *Werther* provoking suicides. For Marxist critics like Sartre or Macherey, literature reveals hidden structures of power.  

### 2. Literature as Play  
Tom Stoppard said, “Art celebrates a world which includes itself.” Literature as play is language freed from duty — “language going on holiday,” in Wittgenstein’s phrase. From Lear’s nonsense to Joyce’s *Finnegans Wake*, such writing re-enchants the medium itself.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Twin Life of Art**  
> The most enduring works do both. Wordsworth’s *“I wandered lonely as a cloud”* is both reflective work and joyous play: a labour of imagination that turns recollection into dancing movement. Its “crowd… host of golden daffodils” is both scene and self-reflection — a mind working and playing at once.

---

## IX. The Ongoing Conversation  

The lecture closes by noting that literature’s definition is always unfinished. Every new work redefines the field — just as every reader redefines what counts as reading.  

> **Mini-Essay — Literature as Process**  
> Literature is not an object but a conversation — between words and worlds, readers and writers, work and play. It is what keeps language alive, and what keeps us answerable to language.  

---

## Motif Tracker  

| **Motif** | **Example(s)** | **Interpretive Use** |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Allusion and Echo** | Hamlet → Prufrock; Beckett → Shakespeare | Literature as repetition-with-difference. |
| **Family Resemblance** | Eagleton via Wittgenstein | Literature as network, not essence. |
| **Canon / Power** | Barthes: “what gets taught” | Institutions shape the literary. |
| **Defamiliarisation** | Shklovsky; Williams’s *This Is Just to Say* | Art as renewal of perception. |
| **Interpretive Community** | Stanley Fish’s “Jacobs-Rosenbaum” | Reading as social act, not solitary discovery. |
| **Work and Play** | Sartre vs. Stoppard | Dual nature of literature’s function. |

---

## Critical Lenses  

| **Axis** | **Relationship** | **Interpretive Implication** |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Imagination ↔ Morality** | Nussbaum, Eliot, Heaney | Reading as ethical rehearsal. |
| **Form ↔ Function** | Shklovsky, Williams | Poetic form transforms ordinary language. |
| **Tradition ↔ Revision** | Ricks, Eliot | Writers keep the canon alive through dialogue. |
| **Culture ↔ Politics** | Barthes, Benjamin | Literature as site of power and critique. |
| **Reader ↔ Text** | Fish, Eagleton | Meaning as negotiated community act. |

---

## Exam Relevance  

### For Oxford Prelims Paper 1B and Paper 3  
- Introduces key critical movements (Formalism, Reader-Response, Marxist and Ethical criticism).  
- Builds foundation for analysing **form, value, and cultural context**.  
- Provides frameworks for essay questions on the definition, function, and ethics of literature.  

### Model Essay Patterns  
1. **“Defining Literature: From Family Resemblance to Interpretive Community.”**  
2. **“Work and Play: The Two Lives of Language.”**  
3. **“Canon and Culture: Who Decides What Literature Is?”**  

### Revision Strategies  
- Compare passages (*Hamlet*, *This Is Just to Say*, *Daffodils*) for different models of literary language.  
- Trace critical genealogies — from De Quincey’s “literature of power” to Eagleton’s “event.”  
- Practise defining literature in a single sentence — then rewrite it five different ways.

# Own Notes


What it is? How it works? Does it matter?

- allusion both is and is not its original --> involves both sameness and difference

- writing by individuals for a larger group of people
- "or" - a model of tolerance and balance --> a sort of ethical values conc. in literature rather than everyday life
- "sea of troubles" - ambiguity allows hamlet to take a cliche and rips--> use words in a way that gives them new life

what makes literature?
- aesthetic form and patterning?
- cultural longevity?
- expression ethical values?
	- writers often argue that morality is often clsoely associated with imagination because it allows us to imagine other's life - "...allows us to rehearse..."
	- MIddlemarch doesnt only depict society but encourages us to recreate it in a more nuanced form
	- BUT aesthetically good =/= morally good
- "make it new"? - a way of refreshing old forms of speech
	- Beckett *How it Is* 
		- "that's not said... interest"

- when describing literature, one is more likely to come up with theoretical rather than empirical deatils (e.g. fictional, human experience etc.) [[Eagleton]]
	- less like criteria, more like family resemblances --> relationships rather than a set of fixed objects that are always open to expansion
		- some resemblences are strong, looser or non-existent
		- // to critical approaches to lit
	- lit as a category that is inherently fuzzy and ever-changing - that in defning soemthing you constrain it

- the answer of "what is literature" is in between the various debates of this topic
	- in the disagreements and agreements


1. History of the word Literature
- [[Raymond Williams Keywords]], " adifficult word"
	- 14th centure - polite learning
- Rennaiscence - Lit began to take on a sense of shared body of knowledge
	- [[Francis Bacon]]
- Romantics - narrowed down Lit to mean creative writing, especially poetry as opposed to factual knowledge
==> shift from dissemination of imagination - exercise of imagination (world as it is to the secondary world the writers dreamt up)

- Literature of Knowledge vs Literature of Power

- Lit as a special category fo writing that has special qualities
- modern critics have argued that lit has returned to its modern roots of meaning anyth
	- argues that Literature should be broadened and democratized toe scape the idea that some works are "better"
	- Lit is not just descriptive but evaluative, to be bound up in heirarchical
		- selection involves rejection
	- Thus, to choose everything as literature and therefore not to choose anyth
		- Literature as a loose synonym of Culture -> anythign that can be expressed in any form, 

2. Literature is "what gets taught" -> centres on the "Canon" - writing that's been elevated to 'classic' status - "canon wars"
	- if lit is a form of linguistic representation, should it not pay homage to social representation, should the canon not reflect the diversity of the society
	- *Harper's Magazine, Arthur Krystal*

Rudyard Kipling
- crucial pivot between the victorian age and modernism

"writers themselves often decide which of their predecessors they want to exist with" (On criticism at the present time)

William Carlos WIlliams, This is Just to Say
- does literature use language in a special way?
	- distract words from their usual burden of representation - usually language has a referential/pragmatic function -->
- resists being read as a poem at all, internal echoes that never quite settle in, flirting with litearry structures but never truly committing
	- a poem that struggles with its twin, a non-poem/anti-poem

 [[Stanley Fish, How to recognize a poem when you see one]] - Literature not a body of writing but a set of social agreements - judgement of an interpretive community
 - primed tor ead it as a poem but because there are other poems in which one eats a poem, feels guilty and means otherwise (milton's paradise lost)

Literature is a complex word - shfiting boundaries probably tell us as much about ourselves as they do about writing - what literature means involves us trying to puzzle out what we mean by literature - what we ened the concept for and what we hope to get from it

- "The address of Poetry Seamus"

1. Literature as a form of Work
	- Work of literature, what does it do?
	- can have an insturmental function - like a speech act ("i now pronounce you husband and wife") it can do something in the act of saying it --> not as immediate can produce a delayed response 
	- reveal ideological structures that are floating around in everyday speech - to prepare the gorund for revolutionary action rather than words
	- Russian formalists - to make us look again at everything we thought we already knew
2. Literature as a form of Play
	- Playwright Tom - Art celebrates a world which includes itself
	- Language going on holiday - they do re-enchant the medium of writing itself - a response to the world as an irresponsible one

- the most celebrated work does both at once (Wordsworth, 'Daffodils')
