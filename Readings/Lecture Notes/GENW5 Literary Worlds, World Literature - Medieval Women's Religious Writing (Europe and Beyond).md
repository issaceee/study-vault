# Medieval Women’s Religious Writing: Europe and Beyond  
### Dr Ayoush Lazikani — Oxford Prelims Paper 2 / FHS 2 (2025)

---

## Introduction: Reading the Female Sacred  

Dr Ayoush Lazikani situates medieval women’s devotional writing within **a global history of religious imagination**.  
The lecture proceeds in three movements:  

1. **Julian of Norwich and Margery Kempe** — English exemplars of visionary writing.  
2. **Continental mystics** — Marie d’Oignies, Lutgard of Aywières, Gertrude the Great, Catherine of Siena, Teresa of Ávila.  
3. **Comparative perspectives** — Islamic Sufis and Hindu Bhakti poets such as Rābiʿa al-ʿAdawiyya, Lallā Ded, and Mīrābāī:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.  

Her aim is not encyclopaedic coverage but a **“cartography of devotion”**: tracing resonances between women separated by geography, language, and creed.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Gender of Vision**  
> Women’s visionary writing arises within patriarchal structures that restrict authority to men, yet these visions **authorise their speakers**. Ecstasy becomes epistemology: bodily feeling generates theological knowledge.  

---

## I. Julian of Norwich (1343– c.1416) — Love as Meaning  

### The Anchorite and Her Revelations  

Julian, the first woman known to have composed a book in English, wrote *Revelations of Divine Love* (c.1373).  
At thirty she fell gravely ill and, believing herself near death, received **sixteen visions** of Christ’s passion, compassion, and indwelling love:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.  

She later expanded her *Short Text* into a *Long Text* after twenty years of meditation — a rare case of a medieval woman revising her own theology.  

Her central claim:  

> “Love was His meaning.”  

God’s nature is **boundless and maternal love**. Julian re-imagines the Trinity as an endlessly generative motherhood:  
Christ labours to bring humanity to birth and nurses it with his blood.  

> **Mini-Essay — Maternal Theology**  
> By naming Christ “Mother,” Julian collapses masculine hierarchy. Her language of gestation and nursing fuses incarnation and creation: divine labour replaces patriarchal law.  

### Sin and Vision  

Julian insists she never “saw” sin itself — only its wounds. Evil lacks substance; it is privation. Her optimism (“All shall be well”) arises from a vision of **cosmic indwelling**: the universe seen as a hazelnut resting in God’s palm.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Hazelnut World**  
> The tiny nut symbolises the finite held within the infinite. Julian’s theology of scale anticipates ecological thought: creation as fragile yet beloved matter.  

---

## II. Margery Kempe (c.1373–after 1438) — The Body in Tears  

A lay woman from King’s Lynn, mother of fourteen, and businesswoman, Margery dictated her *Book* to two scribes.  
It is both spiritual autobiography and travelogue: pilgrimage to Jerusalem, Rome, and Norwich — where she consulted Julian:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.  

Margery’s faith is performed through her body. She weeps uncontrollably at the sight of the crucifix or any violence, and her “boisterous weeping” earns public ridicule and charges of heresy.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Devotional Body**  
> Tears are Margery’s text. In an age that denied women learning, she writes in water what men wrote in ink. Her sob translates vision into sound — a sacramental language of feeling.  

In one episode she sees a mother nursing her child and bursts into tears, recalling Mary and the infant Christ. Every maternal scene becomes an icon.  
Her meeting with Julian anchors her authority: the older anchorite blesses her tears as “the gift of God.”  

---

## III. Continental Mystics: Europe Beyond England  

### Marie d’Oignies (1177–1213) and the Beguines  

In the Low Countries, groups of lay women called **Beguines** lived devoutly without taking vows.  
Marie d’Oignies, from Liège, is described by her confessor Jacques de Vitry as weeping so profusely that “the ground became muddy.”:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
Her tears infect others: the priest who rebukes her for crying is himself overwhelmed by tears at Mass.  

> **Mini-Essay — Contagious Devotion**  
> Emotion is communal and performative. Marie's weeping creates a liturgical circle in which feeling itself is the Eucharist.  

### Lutgard of Aywières (1182–1246)  

A Cistercian nun who experienced visions of drinking from Christ’s side wound:   
> “He embraced her and pressed her mouth to the wound in His right side.”:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  

Erotic and eucharistic imagery merge: union through wound, nourishment through blood.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Erotics of Wounding**  
> The body of Christ becomes both lover and food. Medieval female mysticism renders eros a path to communion, where pain is transfigured into intimacy.  

Lutgard’s vision of Pope Innocent III in purgatory is politically charged: divine justice equalises gender and rank.  

---

## IV. Gertrude the Great (1256–1302) — The Heart as Womb  

Author of *The Herald of Divine Love*, Gertrude developed the cult of the **Sacred Heart**.  
She describes Christ imprinting His wounds upon her heart:  

> “Thou hadst imprinted in the depths of my heart the adorable marks of Thy sacred wounds.”:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  

For Gertrude, Christ’s heart beats within her own; she hears its pulse as speech.  
Alexandra Barratt likens the heart to a **maternal space**, where the devotee returns to the rhythm of the divine womb.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Heart as Habitation**  
> Gertrude makes indwelling literal: devotion as cardiac architecture. The heart is both cradle and cathedral of the Word.  

---

## V. Catherine of Siena (1347–1380) — The Political Mystic  

An Italian Dominican tertiary, Catherine experienced visions of **mystical marriage** to Christ, receiving a ring from the Virgin.  
Her letters — nearly 400 to popes, princes, and lay people — reveal a woman who used visionary authority to influence diplomacy:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}.  

During the War of the Eight Saints she sought to reconcile Florence and the papacy.  
Her politics derive from mysticism: union with Christ becomes a model for social unity.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Politics of Marriage**  
> Catherine’s “mystical marriage” translates private eros into public ethics. The spouse of Christ advises popes — a gendered reversal of authority.  

---

## VI. Teresa of Ávila (1515–1582) — Pain as Ecstasy  

In her *Life*, Teresa describes a vision of an angel piercing her heart with a flaming spear:  

> “He plunged it into my heart several times so that it penetrated to my entrails… The pain was so sweet that I would not wish it to cease.”:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  

Gian Lorenzo Bernini’s *Ecstasy of Saint Teresa* (1652) visualises this moment in baroque marble: bodily surrender as divine rapture.  

Teresa’s visions of hell also display psychological depth: a furnace of “filthy wet mud” and “wicked reptiles” more terrifying than physical pain.  
Hell is not only place but state of mind — separation from God.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Ambivalence of Pleasure**  
> Teresa’s spear-wound and her vision of hell mirror each other: both are penetrations of the soul. Pain and bliss become indistinguishable signs of divine intimacy.  

---

## VII. Beyond Europe: Comparative Mysticisms  

### Lallā Ded (14th c., Kashmir)  

A Shaivite poet-saint, Lallā Ded (“Lal Dād”) wrote short Kashmiri vakhs (poems) celebrating the God Śiva as indwelling spirit:  

> “You hid from me all day, and when I found you hiding inside me I ran wild — now me, now you.”:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  

Her poetry echoes Julian’s doctrine of indwelling love and Gertrude’s heart mysticism.  

> **Mini-Essay — Interior Divinity**  
> The cross-cultural resonance is not in doctrine but in experience: Lallā and Julian both locate God within, making the soul its own monastery.  

### Rābiʿa al-ʿAdawiyya (8th c., Basra)  

The Sufi poet Rābiʿa distinguished two loves of God:  

> “I love You with two loves: a love of passion and a love that is due to You.”:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  

Her poem anticipates Julian’s dual love of desire and grace. Both use the language of eros to purify it into agapē.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Two Loves**  
> Passion is not inferior but gateway to vision. Rābiʿa’s erotic imagery redefines holiness as longing without possession — a love that needs no reward.  

### Mīrābāī (16th c., Rajasthan)  

A princess who renounced royalty to sing for Krishna, Mīrābāī composed songs of devotional friendship.  
Modern iconography shows her dancing before Krishna — the body as instrument of praise.  

> **Mini-Essay — Friendship as Theology**  
> Both Mīrābāī and Margery Kempe model devotion through affectionate companionship rather than hierarchy. Lazikani, following Alexandra Ferrini, calls this “the mysticism of friendship” — cross-cultural empathy as spiritual method.  

---

## Conclusion: The Global Mystic and the Scholar’s Task  

Dr Lazikani ends with a call for **comparative reading as ethical practice**.  
To place Julian beside Rābiʿa, or Margery beside Mīrābāī, is not to erase difference but to **listen across traditions**.  

> **Mini-Essay — Devotion as Dialogue**  
> Comparative mysticism reveals how cultures meet in attention, not assimilation. Each visionary teaches the same method: to see the divine in the other, and the other in the divine.

## Motif Tracker  

| **Motif** | **Example(s)** | **Interpretive Use** |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Maternal Divinity** | Julian’s “Christ as Mother”; Gertrude’s Sacred Heart | The divine reimagined through gestation, feeding, and care; motherhood as model of creation. |
| **Tears and Bodily Devotion** | Margery Kempe; Marie d’Oignies | Physical emotion as text; the body writes what the intellect cannot. |
| **Erotic Mysticism** | Lutgard’s side wound; Teresa’s spear vision | Union with God figured through bodily desire; eros transfigured into communion. |
| **Heart Theology** | Gertrude’s *Herald of Divine Love* | The heart as site of revelation and dwelling; devotion internalised as rhythm. |
| **Authority through Vision** | Julian’s revelations; Catherine’s letters | Vision as licence for female speech; the mystical replaces scholastic authority. |
| **The Politics of Piety** | Catherine mediating papal politics | Mystical intimacy empowering public voice; private revelation turned diplomacy. |
| **Pain and Sweetness** | Teresa’s “pain so sweet”; Julian’s “all shall be well” | Paradox of suffering as joy; affect as spiritual knowledge. |
| **Friendship and Companionship** | Mīrābāī’s songs; Margery’s pilgrims | Devotion imagined as shared intimacy rather than hierarchy; love as equality. |
| **Interior Divinity** | Lallā Ded; Rābiʿa al-ʿAdawiyya | Global resonance of God-within; mystical self as microcosm of the divine. |
| **Comparative Mysticism** | Julian ↔ Lallā Ded; Margery ↔ Mīrābāī | Cross-cultural empathy: seeing the same divine light refracted through different languages. |

---

## Critical Lenses  

| **Axis** | **Relationship** | **Implication** |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Body ↔ Spirit** | Tears, wounds, and ecstasy | Physical sensation as conduit to revelation; holiness felt rather than abstracted. |
| **Gender ↔ Authority** | Female visionaries’ speech | Mystical experience grants women rhetorical and theological power otherwise denied. |
| **Private ↔ Public** | Contemplation and politics | Mysticism as activism; inner transformation reshapes outer order. |
| **Pain ↔ Pleasure** | Teresa’s “sweet pain” | Affective paradox; divine love transcends moral binaries. |
| **Text ↔ Performance** | Dictation, tears, pilgrimage | Writing as embodied act; emotion as authorship. |
| **Local ↔ Global** | England and the wider world | Comparative reading reimagines medieval literature as transnational. |
| **Silence ↔ Speech** | Julian’s secrecy, Margery’s outcry | Voice negotiated through obedience and excess; speech as revelation. |
| **Friendship ↔ Hierarchy** | Mīrābāī’s Krishna songs | Love as equalising force; spiritual democracy across faiths. |

## Exam Relevance  

### Core Relevance to Prelims / FHS Paper 2  

- Broadens the category of **medieval literature** to include women’s visionary prose and global devotional poetry.  
- Demonstrates how religious writing engages questions of **gender, language, and embodiment**.  
- Introduces **cross-cultural comparison** as critical method — linking English, Continental, Islamic, and Indic traditions.  
- Encourages nuanced understanding of **authority and authorship** in pre-modern women’s voices.  

### Analytical Skills  

- Close reading of visionary language: syntax of revelation, metaphors of motherhood, pain, and interiority.  
- Recognising **genre hybridity** — autobiography, theology, lyric, and travel narrative.  
- Integrating **material culture and art** (manuscripts, sculpture, Bernini’s *Ecstasy of St Teresa*).  
- Applying theoretical lenses (feminist, postcolonial, comparative theology).  

### Model Essay Patterns  

1. **“Love was His meaning.”** — Examine how medieval women use affect and metaphor to articulate theology.  
2. **“The body is the page.”** — Discuss embodiment as authorship in Margery Kempe and Teresa of Ávila.  
3. **“Mysticism is politics.”** — Analyse Catherine of Siena and Lallā Ded as public theologians.  
4. **“Across traditions, the language of desire becomes the language of God.”** — Compare Julian with Rābiʿa or Mīrābāī.  

### Revision Strategies  

- Learn key visions (Julian’s hazelnut, Teresa’s spear, Lutgard’s wound) and their theological meanings.  
- Trace the **lexicon of love** — “sweetness,” “wound,” “mother,” “friendship.”  
- Compare **translation and mediation**: many texts exist through male scribes or hagiographers.  
- Reflect on **methodological humility** — how modern reading risks domesticating radical experience.
