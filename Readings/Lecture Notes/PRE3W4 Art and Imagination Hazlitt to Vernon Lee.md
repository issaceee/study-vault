## Introduction: Poetry That Looks and Pictures That Speak  

Victorian poets were obsessed with **making art speak** — translating visual art into words, emotion, and time. Fergus McGhee notes that the late nineteenth century saw an unprecedented vogue for poems about pictures: *“Never before had so many poems been written about pictures; the genre became a site of extraordinary experimental energy”* (McGhee 2025).  

These experiments belong to the ancient tradition of **ekphrasis** — from the Greek *ekphrazein*, “to speak out.” In classical rhetoric, the term meant vivid description (*enargeia*), a way to animate the mind’s eye. By the Victorian period, it had narrowed to mean a **literary response to a visual artwork** — not just description but interpretation, imitation, or even rivalry.  

> **Mini-Essay — Ekphrasis as Encounter**  
> Ekphrasis is a *meeting of the arts*: painting’s stillness meets poetry’s voice. Each poem must decide whether to *speak to*, *speak for*, or *speak about* the artwork — an ethical as well as aesthetic decision. The poet’s words risk trespassing on the painter’s silence, yet they also reveal how both arts depend on imagination to bridge what can be seen and what can be said.

## I. Theories of Ekphrasis: Kinship, Rivalry, and Gender  

### Horace to Heffernan: The Sister Arts  

The idea that poetry and painting share common ground goes back to **Horace’s dictum**, *ut pictura poesis* — “as is painting, so is poetry.” Both arts are representational: they make visible what is otherwise hidden. **Plutarch**, borrowing from Simonides of Ceos, declared, “painting is mute poetry, and poetry a speaking picture.”  

James **Heffernan** defines ekphrasis as *“the verbal representation of visual representation”* (1993), stressing translation rather than subordination. Ekphrasis allows the poet to act as both viewer and interpreter — to show how perception itself is creative.  

### Lessing and the *Paragone*  

In 1766, **Gotthold Ephraim Lessing** rejected this analogy in *Laocoön: An Essay on the Limits of Painting and Poetry*. He insisted that the arts belong to different realms:  
> “Succession in time is the province of the poet; coexistence in space that of the artist.”  

For Lessing, painting freezes a single instant of space, while poetry unfolds over time. Yet this clarity masks a deeper hierarchy: painting, like the feminine body, is silent and decorative; poetry, like masculine intellect, speaks and acts. **W. J. T. Mitchell** exposes this gendered bias:  
> “Paintings, like women, are ideally silent, beautiful creatures designed for the gratification of the eye, in contrast to the sublime eloquence proper to the manly art of poetry.” (Mitchell 1986)

> **Mini-Essay — The Gender of Silence**  
> Ekphrasis inherits a patriarchal script. The “mute” artwork — feminised, passive, beautiful — awaits the poet’s animation. For women poets like Christina Rossetti or Michael Field, to “make art speak” was not just aesthetic play but a challenge to Lessing’s hierarchy: could one *listen* to the painting rather than dominate it? Could one write with, not over, the image?

### Ekphrasis as Interpretation  

Stephen **Cheeke** describes ekphrasis as *“dynamic and obstetric”* — delivering from the pregnant moment of the visual the narrative it only implies (2008). The poet claims to know what the picture withholds, yet also discovers that description distorts. Ekphrasis therefore embodies what McGhee calls “a double-edged act of revelation and concealment” (McGhee 2025).  

> **Mini-Essay — The Ethics of Description**  
> The ekphrastic poet is never neutral. To describe a picture is to interpret it — to choose what matters and what does not. Every act of description hides another. Ekphrasis thus becomes a metaphor for reading itself: a process of seeing through and seeing past the surface.

## II. Michael Field: *Sight and Song* (1892) — The Poem as Translation  

Among the richest Victorian experiments in ekphrasis is *Sight and Song* (1892), a collection by **Michael Field** — the shared pseudonym of Katherine Bradley and Edith Cooper. The book contains thirty-three poems, each based on a specific painting viewed in European galleries. No reproductions were included; the reader must imagine each picture through words alone (Field 1892).  

Critics such as W. B. Yeats dismissed the collection as “a guidebook to the picture galleries of Europe.” Yet its restraint conceals daring innovation. The poets present themselves not as interpreters of feeling but as **translators of visual form**. Their aim, stated in the preface, is “to express not so much what these pictures are to the poet, but rather what poetry they objectively incarnate” (*Preface* to *Sight and Song*).  

Bradley explained the method in a letter: *“There are poems in them, and one has only to stare and wait till they give up their secret”* (Bradley to Costelloe, 1891). The poet becomes an instrument of perception — waiting, listening, translating.  

### Impersonality and Imagination  

In the preface, Bradley and Cooper cite **Flaubert’s** dictum: *“One must, by an effort of mind, transport oneself into the characters and not draw them towards oneself.”* Substituting *paintings* for *characters*, they advocate impersonality: to see things “from their own centre.” Yet, as Walter **Pater** noted in his review of Flaubert, total objectivity is impossible: *“The artist will be felt; his subjectivity must and will colour the incidents”* (Pater 1888).  

The Fields acknowledge this paradox: to translate an image “honestly and with persistence” still leaves “the inevitable force of individuality.” Their art aspires to efface the self while recognising its shadow.  

> **Mini-Essay — Translation as Ethics**  
> *Sight and Song* transforms looking into moral practice. To translate without domination — to see as the image sees — becomes an ethical ideal. The poet must suppress ego and habit to encounter the artwork’s “otherness.” Ekphrasis thus models attentive, self-forgetting observation: an art of humility.

### Painting and Prosody  

Michael Field’s preface declares their purpose “to translate into verse what the lines and colours of certain chosen pictures sing in themselves.” The goal is not paraphrase but **transposition** — turning brushstrokes into rhythm, pigment into metre. As Pater had warned in *The School of Giorgione* (1877), it is a mistake to treat art forms as mere translations of a shared “quantity of imaginative thought.” What matters are the “sensuous elements in art” — colour, sound, texture — which *Sight and Song* seeks to render verbally.  

This aspiration challenges Lessing’s separation of time and space: the poets make poetry **painterly**, using rhythm as line and page-space as canvas.  

### *Venus, Mercury, and Cupid* — Correggio and the Education of Desire  

In *Venus, Mercury, and Cupid*, the poets describe Correggio’s Renaissance painting (National Gallery, c.1525), in which Mercury teaches Cupid to read while Venus looks on. The poem’s structure mirrors the painting’s triadic composition: three stanzas of interlaced rhyme (aba ccc). The syntax pauses and suspends, mimicking the painting’s stillness.  

McGhee notes that each stanza is catalectic — missing the final syllable of its metre — forcing the reader into silence at each line’s end (McGhee 2025). This incomplete rhythm emulates the *poised tension* of the painted figures: Venus’s contemplative stillness, Cupid’s concentration, Mercury’s gesture.  

> **Mini-Essay — Poetry that Looks**  
> The Fields’ verse aspires to *stillness*. By truncating its metre, it holds time in check, turning verse into image. Yet even as the poem freezes, syntax flows; the artwork’s spatial harmony becomes a temporal sequence. Ekphrasis becomes not imitation but **transformation** — poetry discovering its own pictorial mode.

## III. Seeing, Knowing, and Time  

### Ekphrasis and the Desire for Stillness  

As Wendy **Steiner** observes, ekphrastic poetry “aspires to the atemporal eternity of the stopped-action painting, or laments its inability to achieve it” (Steiner 1988). *Sight and Song* embodies this paradox: its poems suspend time even as language unfolds.  

This longing for timelessness recalls **Keats’s** *Ode on a Grecian Urn* (1819), whose lovers are “for ever fair, for ever young” — poised between fulfilment and frustration. The frozen moment promises eternity, yet also death-in-life.  

**Murray Krieger** argued that ekphrasis reveals itself whenever poetry takes on the “still” qualities of visual art (Krieger 1992). **Michael Baxandall**, by contrast, reminded us that looking is always temporal: even if a picture exists all at once, “our eyes have the pleasure of wandering over its surface and returning to it again and again” (Baxandall 1985).  

**Vernon Lee** likewise wrote that great pictures “are made to be seen at several goes” — “for leisurely living with, not to make one *bang!* impression with a visual image banged into your brain like a seal on wax” (Lee 1904). To look, like to read, is to dwell in time.  

**John Ruskin** put it most succinctly: “No human capacity ever yet saw the whole of a thing; we may see more and more of it the longer we look” (*Modern Painters IV*, 1856).  

> **Mini-Essay — The Poem as Looking**  
> Ekphrasis redefines reading as *a form of seeing*. To follow a poem’s unfolding syntax is to trace the movement of the eye over a picture — halting, revisiting, returning. The image teaches the poet to slow down, to inhabit duration. The poem’s temporality becomes the very medium of attention.

## IV. Rossetti, Wharton, and the Speaking Picture  

### Rossetti’s *Proserpine* (1872): The Art of Listening  

**Dante Gabriel Rossetti’s** *Proserpine (For a Picture)* (1872) gives voice to the mythic figure he painted: the goddess trapped in Hades after tasting the pomegranate. Unlike most ekphrastic poems, this one is written in the **voice of the image itself**. Proserpine speaks — yet her speech is haunted by distance and echo:  

> *“Afar from mine own self I seem, and wing  
> Strange ways in thought, and listen for a sign.”*  

As **Jerome McGann** notes, the poem creates “an uncanny sense that Proserpine is listening for the very poem she herself appears to be authoring.” The artwork, silent and static, becomes an active listener. Ekphrasis turns inward: **the image hears us**.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Speaking Image**  
> Rossetti reverses the hierarchy of voice and silence. The poem no longer speaks *for* the picture; it imagines the picture speaking *back*. Ekphrasis becomes reciprocal, not possessive — a dialogue across media and worlds.

### Rossetti’s *For Spring, by Botticelli* (1881): Mystery and Silence  

In *For Spring (by Botticelli)*, Rossetti questions the painting’s meaning:  
> *“What mystery here is read / Of homage or of hope?”*  

The image refuses to answer. McGhee notes that this reticence recalls **Plato’s** *Phaedrus*, where writing, like painting, “seems to speak, yet remains silent.” The painting’s silence becomes its eloquence: a mystery that rebukes the poet’s impatience.  

**Pater**, in “The Myth of Demeter and Persephone” (1876), reminds us that *mystery* derives from *muein* — to close the lips. Silence, then, is not lack but depth.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Silence That Speaks**  
> For Rossetti, Botticelli’s mute figures embody the sacred reserve of art. To “make art speak” may mean to listen more closely to its silence. Ekphrasis becomes contemplation — a reverent form of reading that honours what remains unsaid.

### Edith Wharton: *The “Apollo and Marsyas” of Perugino*  

Wharton’s sonnet (c.1890s) imagines the mythic contest between the god Apollo and the satyr Marsyas. The poem knows what the painting does not: that Marsyas will soon be flayed alive.  
> *“Inscrutably serene the young god stands / In prescience inaccessible, his eyes / Bright with the fumes of mortal sacrifice.”*  

Here, ekphrasis gives the poet narrative omniscience — the power to restore the temporal dimension the painting withholds. Yet Apollo’s calm detachment becomes an emblem of art’s *inhuman serenity*: the price of aesthetic distance.  

> **Mini-Essay — Knowledge and Violence**  
> Wharton’s poem turns knowing into cruelty. To see ahead of the image is to wound it. Ekphrasis thus stages an ethical drama between insight and invasion: to interpret may also mean to harm.

---

## V. Vernon Lee and Aesthetic Responsibility  

**Vernon Lee** (Violet Paget) extended ekphrasis beyond description to psychology. In *Aesthetic Responsiveness* (1912), she argued that there is no such thing as “pure aesthetic attention,” only “various states of our whole being” responding to art. To look is to feel; to feel is to judge.  

Lee’s insight recasts ekphrasis as **ethics**. The poet’s address to art mirrors our address to other minds. **W. J. T. Mitchell** makes this link explicit: “The ambivalence about ekphrasis is grounded in our ambivalence about other people” (1992). The silent painting is an analogue for the human other — remote, inscrutable, desiring contact.  

> **Mini-Essay — Ekphrasis as Ethics of Attention**  
> To describe art is to practice empathy: an act of listening to what cannot answer. Lee’s “aesthetic responsiveness” extends the moral imagination of literature itself — to respond with care, to inhabit without mastering. Ekphrasis becomes a microcosm of relational ethics: the aesthetic as human encounter.

---

## Conclusion: The Speaking Picture and the Reading Eye  

Victorian ekphrasis transforms a classical rhetorical exercise into a **modern meditation on art, gender, and sympathy**. From Pater’s sensuous criticism to Michael Field’s impersonal translation, from Rossetti’s haunted silence to Lee’s responsive gaze, poets and critics alike explore what happens when the visual and verbal cross.  

To “make art speak” is not to conquer its silence but to enter into it — to learn that every act of description is an act of relation. Ekphrasis, in McGhee’s words, *“shows that the experience of art is never detached from the experience of the world and the people in it”* (McGhee 2025).  

> **Mini-Essay — The Final Dialogue**  
> The poet and the image stand as mirrors: one seeking to speak, the other to be heard. Between them lies the true subject of ekphrasis — not art itself, but the human capacity for attention, imagination, and empathy.

## Motif Tracker

| **Motif** | **Example(s)** | **Interpretive Use** |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Speech and Silence** | Rossetti’s *Proserpine*; Plato’s *Phaedrus* | The dialogue between voice and muteness: art’s power lies equally in what it withholds. |
| **Time and Stillness** | *Sight and Song*; Keats’s *Ode on a Grecian Urn* | The poem’s temporality translates the painting’s stillness; the “frozen moment” becomes moral and emotional duration. |
| **Gender and Art** | Mitchell’s “feminine silence” of painting; Michael Field’s impersonality | Ekphrasis as negotiation of gendered hierarchies — reclaiming the right to speak for and with art. |
| **Translation / Transposition** | *Sight and Song* preface; Pater’s “School of Giorgione” | Verbalising colour and line; poetry as act of translation rather than imitation. |
| **Ethics of Attention** | Vernon Lee’s *Aesthetic Responsiveness* | Looking as moral action; aesthetic encounter as empathy without mastery. |
| **Voice of the Image** | Rossetti’s dramatic monologues of paintings | The painting’s imagined self-consciousness; art as speaking subject. |
| **Mystery / Concealment** | Pater’s “Myth of Demeter and Persephone”; Rossetti’s “For Spring” | Silence as sacred reserve; the divine secrecy of beauty. |
| **Violence of Knowing** | Wharton’s *Apollo and Marsyas* | Interpretation as invasion; the poet’s knowledge becomes cruelty. |

## Critical Lenses

| **Axis** | **Relationship** | **Implication** |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Image ↔ Word** | Mutual translation between visual and verbal arts | The boundaries between arts are porous; meaning is created through crossing forms. |
| **Speech ↔ Silence** | The poet’s voice versus the painting’s mute presence | Ekphrasis dramatizes power, gender, and the ethics of interpretation. |
| **Time ↔ Space** | Lessing’s distinction between temporal poetry and spatial painting | Victorian ekphrasis collapses this division; verse becomes visual. |
| **Self ↔ Other** | The viewer’s projection into the artwork | To look ethically is to imagine without appropriation. |
| **Gender ↔ Authority** | Female artists reclaiming voice in male-dominated discourse | Ekphrasis as feminist rewriting of the “mute” female image. |
| **Description ↔ Creation** | From observation to invention | The poet’s “translation” becomes new art: description as re-creation. |
| **Silence ↔ Mystery** | The ineffable as aesthetic ideal | The painting’s refusal to speak sustains the poem’s reverence and humility. |

## Exam Relevance  

### Core Relevance to Oxford Prelims Paper 3 (1830–1910)

- **Art and Literature:** Introduces the central nineteenth-century question: *What happens when one art form tries to think through another?*  
- **Critical Experiment:** Models how literary form becomes a method of analysis — the poem as criticism, the critic as artist.  
- **Interdisciplinary Thinking:** Connects art history, philosophy, and poetics (Horace, Lessing, Mitchell, Pater, Lee).  
- **Ethics and Aesthetics:** Explores attention, sympathy, and humility as moral values enacted through art.  

### Analytical Skills

- Linking **form and idea** — how metre, syntax, and imagery replicate visual perception.  
- Practising **close reading** as *looking*: attending to silence, lineation, and rhythm as equivalents of brushstroke and colour.  
- Framing **artistic dialogue** — comparing verbal and visual modes without reducing one to the other.  

### Model Essay Patterns  

1. **“Ekphrasis is a dialogue between the living and the still.”**  
   — Compare Michael Field’s *Sight and Song* with Rossetti’s *Proserpine*: how does each imagine art’s voice?  

2. **“To describe is to trespass.”**  
   — Evaluate the ethics of description in Wharton’s *Apollo and Marsyas* and Lee’s *Aesthetic Responsiveness*.  

3. **“Silence is the truest speech of art.”**  
   — Discuss the value of silence and mystery in Pater and Rossetti as critics of beauty.  

### Revision Strategies  

- Study how ekphrasis reframes **gender and authorship** — especially in Michael Field’s preface and Mitchell’s critique of Lessing.  
- Compare **Victorian ekphrasis** with Romantic precedents (Keats’s *Ode on a Grecian Urn*).  
- Revisit **artworks in context** — Correggio’s *Venus, Mercury and Cupid*, Botticelli’s *Primavera*, Perugino’s *Apollo and Marsyas*.  
- Practise writing your own short ekphrastic paragraph to grasp the challenges of voice, description, and ethics.
