- rhythm --> individual ambitions vs social expectations; routine vs compulsion; fate vs free will; ideal vs real etc.

two competing attitudes
- rhythm as shared patterning of thought - privat desires to be articulated in public form, allows writers to settle their feet and dsettle thier difference
- for hardy, rhythm is an outdated mould in which the speaker struggles against

why does rhythm provide suhc mixed meaning? what is it for and what does it do?
- metre as framing and composing an idea

- relationship between tragedy and comedy? if metre comes from the word emaning measure, one of the things it asks us to measure is our own response to situations that could be sad, funny or smth in between

- metre as a structure of perfect expectation and fulfillment
	- but the same is not true of metrical theory - nobody is q sure how metrical analysis (prosody) should be done

forms of verse
- syllabic - fixed number of syllables on each line (haikus etc)
- accentual - according to fix number of accents/stresses regardless of the number of unstressed (old english verse and 20th centure)
- quantitative - each syllable as duration rather than accents (long sounrs - 'o' in howl, short sounds 'o' in horror --> latin and greek verse; experimented in english as well)
- accentual-syllabic (most popular in english - fixed no. of stressors and syllables on the same line )

difficulties:
- working out the metre of the poem wont tell you which word is to be stressed - Source 11
- extracting a pulse from a piece of writing reminds u that a pulse isnt a pulse unless its moving - Source 12

tip: read the line aloud in order to ehar how it settles into patterns or how it breaks away from them

instead of asking - what metre is this poem in? ask what in this poem is not in its metre?
- shows us how a line of thought doesnt fit into its metrical framework --> indicates failures - writer's difficulty in imposing order and routine in a messy woirld
