## Introduction: Reading across Language Difference  

This collaborative lecture stages the very principle it discusses: *translation as dialogue*.  
Evangelista and Reynolds alternate voices to model how meaning travels between speakers, languages, and academic traditions:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.  

Their argument begins with a provocation: nineteenth-century British literature was *never monolingual*.  
“Victorian literature,” Evangelista insists, “was written **with English, not in English**.”  
To write in English was always to negotiate other linguistic presences — French, Italian, Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, or dialect.  

Modern readers, too, inhabit varied “**language repertoires**”: fragments of dialect, code-switching, online speech, musical or programming idioms.  
Reading, therefore, becomes an act of navigating between these repertoires rather than remaining inside a single, self-sufficient tongue.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Continuum of Language Difference**  
> “There are no languages, only varieties,” Reynolds suggests.  
> What we call *English* is a slice cut from a continuum of speech stretching into neighbouring tongues.  
> Translation, then, is not movement between sealed systems but **communication within a field of difference**.

## I. Translation and the Voice of the Page  

### Print as Medium and Border  

Print, Reynolds observes, simultaneously **flattens and circulates** language difference.  
In typography, accent and intonation vanish, yet print also enables contact across linguistic borders.  
Christina Rossetti’s bilingualism illustrates this paradox: she wrote poems in both Italian and English.  

> “Writing in English,” Evangelista notes, “was itself a choice — a gesture toward a particular market and readership.”  

Her decision to use English was not a neutral act but a **translation of self** into a different literary economy.  

> **Mini-Essay — Silenced Accents**  
> Print makes voices appear uniform, but multilingual traces survive in spelling, rhythm, and imagery.  
> The “flattening” of accent in type paradoxically makes language more portable: difference muted yet mobile.

## II. Foreign Language within English Texts  

### Charlotte Brontë — *Jane Eyre* (1847)  

In the storm-tossed scene after Jane’s failed wedding, she overhears voices speaking German through a window.  
The novel prints the German lines without translation, forcing readers into Jane’s position — outside, listening, uncertain:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.  

Some readers recognise Schiller; others do not.  The unglossed passage creates **hierarchy and estrangement**, reminding us that English fiction often stages untranslatability.  

> **Mini-Essay — Encountering the Untranslated**  
> Foreign words on the page dramatise exclusion and longing.  
> The untranslatable moment becomes part of the novel’s moral structure: empathy born from not understanding.

### Robert Browning — Multilingual Dramatic Monologue  

Browning’s speakers — Italian dukes, French clerics, Greek playwrights — occupy linguistic worlds readers cannot hear directly.  
Early monologues, like *My Last Duchess*, depend on the “myth of instant translation,” the fantasy that we can overhear another culture in our own tongue.  

By the 1860s Browning foregrounds difficulty: *Aristophanes’ Apology* mixes Greek, English, and Italian.  
Meaning fragments into code-switching, making readers stumble phonetically.  

> **Mini-Essay — Hearing through Babel**  
> Browning’s polyglot lines dramatise the impossibility of total empathy.  
> His poems reveal how art both bridges and exposes linguistic difference.

### Arthur Hugh Clough — *Amours de Voyage* (1858)  

Clough litters his epistolary poem with foreign epigraphs and colloquial French (*“mettre en rapport”*).  
The mild foreignness both unites and separates speaker and addressee, suggesting that **true connection requires mistranslation**.  

---

## III. Walter Pater — *Marius the Epicurean* (1885)  

Set in imperial Rome, Pater’s novel begins with a block of Latin poetry.  
The unreadable opening immerses readers in antiquity while establishing a **hierarchy of literacy**: some decode, others pause.  

Pater’s prose later incorporates translated fragments from Apuleius’s *Golden Ass* and Latin syntax woven into English periods.  
Critics note how his sentences “think in Latin,” adopting its grammatical skeleton to express alien time and thought:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.  

> **Mini-Essay — Transitionality and Translatability**  
> Pater fuses ancient and modern through syntax itself.  
> His English is already a translation — a hybrid tongue where classical cadence reshapes modern thought.

When Marius and Cornelius read the tale of Cupid and Psyche, Pater includes his own 20-page translation, embedding translation as narrative device.  
The novel becomes **a collage of voices**, challenging the boundary between original and copy.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Novel as Translation**  
> By inserting translated text inside fiction, Pater turns reading into archaeology.  
> Translation is not commentary but composition — an act of creative continuity between epochs.

---

## IV. George Eliot — Epigraphs and Difficulty  

Eliot’s novels, especially *Daniel Deronda*, open chapters with foreign-language epigraphs.  
She could easily have translated them but chose not to.  

> “Why does she leave them?” Evangelista asks.  
> To slow the reader down, to create “an encounter with difference.”  

Eliot transforms translation into **pedagogy**: by making comprehension laborious, she models the ethical patience her novels demand.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Ethics of Difficulty**  
> Eliot’s untranslated epigraphs remind readers that moral understanding, like linguistic understanding, requires work.  
> Difficulty becomes a virtue — reading as slow hospitality.

---

## V. Torulata Dutt (1856–77) — *A Sheaf Gleaned in French Fields*  

Born in Calcutta, Dutt was fluent in English and French, conversant in Bengali and Sanskrit.  
Her 1876 collection, published in Calcutta, translated over a hundred contemporary French poems.  
The first poem prints French and English side-by-side; later pages drop the original, leaving a **ghostly bilingualism**:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.  

In “Reflections,” Dutt likens the mind to a mirror where another’s face appears:  
translation becomes **the act of finding another consciousness within one’s own**.  

> **Mini-Essay — Translation as Reflection**  
> Dutt’s image of mirrored faces anticipates modern theories of intertextuality.  
> Translation is empathy — a fusion of voices that redefines authorship as relational.  

Her final sonnet addresses her father, asking him to read her versions while remembering the French originals — a family of languages held in memory.  

---

## VI. Edward FitzGerald — *Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám* (1859)  

First issued anonymously as *“translated into English verse”*, not as an original poem, FitzGerald’s *Rubáiyát* erased its translator’s identity.  
Only later was it canonised as an “English classic.”  

FitzGerald’s Persian manuscript reached him from Calcutta; thus the text’s trajectory reversed Dutt’s — **Asia translating into England**.  
His self-effacement enacts the paradox of translation: to make another voice audible, the translator must disappear.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Erased Translator**  
> FitzGerald’s anonymity performs humility as authorship.  
> Yet later canonisation re-inscribes ownership, turning translation back into property — a parable of empire’s linguistic appropriation.

---

## VII. Tennyson’s Multilingual Library  

In Tennyson’s preserved library in Lincoln, barely two-thirds of the books are in English; the rest span Latin, Italian, German, Hebrew, and even Chinese.  
He and his wife Emily read *Dante* together with a dictionary, “picking their way” through unfamiliar words.  
Fluency was not the point: *partial understanding fuelled creativity*.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Joy of Not Knowing**  
> Tennyson proves that incomprehension can be generative.  
> The poetic imagination feeds on fragments half-understood; mistranslation becomes a source of rhythm and wonder.

---

## VIII. The History of Victorian Translation  

Evangelista offers a panoramic chronology:  

| Decade | Example | Significance |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| 1840s–50s | George Eliot’s translations of Strauss and Feuerbach | Philosophical mediation; translation as apprenticeship to thought. |
| 1861 | D. G. Rossetti’s *Early Italian Poets* | Recovery of origins; Pre-Raphaelite primitivism in verse. |
| 1870s–80s | William Morris’s Icelandic sagas | Archaeology of the North; revival of myth through craft. |
| 1879–1910 | Max Müller’s *Sacred Books of the East* | Imperial translation project linking linguistics and Orientalism. |
| 1880s | Russian novels via French | Triangular mediation: Tolstoy and Dostoevsky filtered through Paris. |
| 1890s | Scandinavian drama and French Symbolism | Ibsen and Baudelaire translated as moral and aesthetic shock. |

> **Mini-Essay — Translation as Empire and Exchange**  
> The century’s translation networks mirror global power structures but also unsettle them: knowledge circulates unpredictably, challenging the hierarchy of “original” and “copy.”

## IX. Language, Standardisation, and the Myth of “English”  

Reynolds closes by questioning the very existence of discrete languages.  
“There are,” he quotes, “few agreed criteria for when two ways of speaking count as the same language.”  
Dialects reveal a **continuum of difference**: North-Eastern English overlaps Scandinavian; Hindi shades into Urdu.  

Writing and printing standardise fluid speech, slicing the continuum for political ends.  
Dictionaries, grammars, and education systems enforce borders where none naturally exist.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Politics of Standardisation**  
> “Languages” are inventions of the state: dictionaries make nations by declaring which spellings belong.  
> Translation, then, exposes this artifice — every act of paraphrase reminding us that English itself is a translation of its own multiplicity.  

Reynolds invokes the colonial *Linguistic Survey of India* (1894–1928):  
cataloguers confronted unclassifiable variety and had to draw arbitrary lines between “languages.”  
Standardisation thus becomes both epistemic violence and creative order.  

---

## X. Heterolingual Address: The Reader as Translator  

Drawing on the theorist Naoki Sakai, Reynolds defines **heterolingual address**: the condition of always speaking across difference.  
Even “native speakers,” he reminds students, are **learners trained by correction**; fluency is social fiction.  

Reading and essay-writing are therefore acts of translation — moving a text’s language into our own interpretive idiom.  
To study literature in English is to study **English as a multilingual practice**.  

> **Mini-Essay — Translation as Criticism**  
> Every act of interpretation is translational: the critic becomes a second author.  
> Reading, writing, and thinking are modes of listening across the gap between voices.

---

## XI. Michael Field — *Long Ago* (1889)  

The lecture ends with Michael Field (Katherine Bradley and Edith Cooper), whose collection *Long Ago* reimagines Sappho’s Greek fragments.  
Each poem prints the original Greek in red ink, followed by an English “extension” of the fragment:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.  

> **Mini-Essay — Fragment and Afterlife**  
> The red Greek letters, costly to print, become relics: translation as material devotion.  
> Field’s improvisations make translation a form of resurrection — reviving lost voices through creative love.  

Their Sappho, mediated by archaeology and desire, joins Pater’s and Eliot’s projects: translation as historical and erotic communion.  
For Evangelista and Reynolds, this final example fuses all others — the global, the ancient, the female, the modern — into a single act of **multilingual imagination**.

---

## Conclusion: Reading as Translational Practice  

Translation, in this lecture, is not supplement but **definition of literature itself**.  
From Rossetti’s Italian poems to Dutt’s Calcutta sonnets, from Eliot’s epigraphs to Field’s red-ink fragments, nineteenth-century writing exists in a spectrum of linguistic relation.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Reader as Polyglot**  
> To read responsibly is to hear the foreign in the familiar, to let English speak in many accents.  
> Literature in English is, and always has been, literature **with English** — a chorus rather than a monologue.

---

## Motif Tracker  

| **Motif** | **Example(s)** | **Interpretive Use** |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Language Continuum** | Reynolds on dialect overlap; print standardisation | Undermines idea of discrete languages; translation reveals linguistic interdependence. |
| **Untranslated Fragments** | Pater’s Latin; Eliot’s epigraphs | Stages encounter with difference; slowing down as ethical reading practice. |
| **Embedded Translation** | Pater’s *Cupid and Psyche*; Dutt’s *Sheaf Gleaned* | Translation as part of composition; intertextuality becomes authorship. |
| **Print and Voice** | Rossetti’s choice of English; flattening of accents | Print as both erasure and conduit of linguistic diversity. |
| **Ethics of Difficulty** | Eliot’s foreign epigraphs; Brontë’s German dialogue | Reading as moral patience; comprehension as respect for alterity. |
| **Empire and Exchange** | FitzGerald’s *Rubáiyát*; Müller’s *Sacred Books of the East* | Translation entangled with colonial power yet enabling cultural circulation. |
| **Partial Understanding** | Tennyson reading Dante with a dictionary | Miscomprehension as creative stimulus; ignorance becomes invention. |
| **The Erased Translator** | FitzGerald’s anonymity | Visibility and effacement in cultural transmission; authorship dissolved. |
| **Heterolingual Address** | Sakai’s theory; Evangelista & Reynolds’s dialogue | Communication premised on difference; reading as an act of translation. |
| **Fragment and Resurrection** | Michael Field’s *Long Ago* | Translation as revival of the lost; fragment turned into afterlife. |

---

## Critical Lenses  

| **Axis** | **Relationship** | **Implication** |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Original ↔ Copy** | Translation as imitation or extension | Challenges hierarchy of authenticity; translation as creative continuation. |
| **Language ↔ Power** | Colonial translation projects | Reveals linguistic borders as instruments of empire and taxonomy. |
| **Reader ↔ Text** | Heterolingual address | Every reader becomes translator; meaning negotiated across distance. |
| **Comprehension ↔ Estrangement** | Untranslated passages | Difficulty as ethical encounter; alienation generates empathy. |
| **Print ↔ Speech** | Typography versus accent | Standardisation silences local voice yet enables transnational dialogue. |
| **Faithfulness ↔ Freedom** | Dutt’s adaptive translations; FitzGerald’s *Rubáiyát* | Fidelity redefined as relational creativity rather than servitude. |
| **History ↔ Modernity** | Pater’s Latinised English | The ancient survives through stylistic translation; continuity through anachronism. |
| **Gender ↔ Voice** | Michael Field’s Sappho | Translation as queer resurrection; feminine voice recovered through re-creation. |

## Exam Relevance  

### Core Relevance to Prelims Paper 3 (1830–1910)

- Expands understanding of **literature in English as transnational practice**.  
- Demonstrates how **translation, adaptation, and multilingualism** shape nineteenth-century aesthetics.  
- Encourages analysis of **paratextual features** — epigraphs, prefaces, typography — as integral to meaning.  
- Builds foundation for comparative study across periods, languages, and media.  

### Analytical Skills  

- Reading the **visual and typographical** as linguistic choices.  
- Interpreting **translation within the text** (e.g., Pater’s embedded Latin).  
- Contextualising works within **print culture and empire**.  
- Writing essays that balance **close reading with historical linguistics**.  

### Model Essay Patterns  

1. **“All reading is translation.”** — Discuss using Eliot’s epigraphs and Dutt’s bilingual poetry.  
2. **“Difficulty is the form of empathy.”** — Examine untranslated language in Pater, Eliot, and Brontë.  
3. **“Translation was the Victorian mode of worldliness.”** — Explore how FitzGerald and Field redefine authorship through adaptation.  
4. **“Languages are not borders but bridges.”** — Evaluate Reynolds’s claim through Tennyson, Dutt, and the *Rubáiyát*.  

### Revision Strategies  

- Memorise examples of **embedded translation** (Pater, Field) and **untranslated language** (Eliot, Brontë).  
- Trace how **print technology** affects multilingual representation.  
- Relate translation to **imperial context** (Müller, FitzGerald) and **comparative cosmopolitanism** (Dutt).  
- Practise framing translation as **method, not theme** — how form itself enacts cross-linguistic movement.

# Own Notes
- reading becomes a parctice of navigating various language 'repertoire' or a varied language space
- literature in english is in dialogue with a bunch of variouss languages
	- when rosetti writes in english, there is a choice to write for a specifc market
	- need to be cognizant of the role of print as well... how it flattens language difference (erases accents) or enables connection over language difference

- when language is not translated in a text
	- stages an encounter with difference

walter Pater, marius the Epicurean intreoduction
- chunk of latin in the first page
- foreign language ysed to create an atmposphere of alienness
- creating a hierarchy of readers

* transitionality and translationailty*
* - fusing of modern and acient through translation strategies

Pater writes his own translation to the Story of Cupid and Psyche

- how do we understand translation as part of the written work? is it still part of the written work?

- george elliots - epigraphs - some are in different languages --> why does she leave it in foregin language and not translate? - the idea of difficulty, of slowing down of alienation--> how she understands the novel as a means that creats webs of intertextual and intercultureal


- text that are published as translations

- translation as a process for reflection - somebody else's words in your writing

rubaiyat of omar khayyam



*how the arrival of different media changes translation*
- periodical culture which in itself is a form of translation

continuum of language difference that has been chopped up
