## Introduction: The Trouble with Paraphrase  

Paraphrase, one of the oldest tools in the critic’s repertoire, seems innocent enough — to restate a text “in different words.” Yet its long history reveals both suspicion and admiration. Is paraphrase a **clarifying act** or a **betrayal of art**?  

This lecture explores how critics, poets, and philosophers — from Quintilian to Cleanth Brooks — have debated its merits, and how modern criticism might use paraphrase not as reduction but as a **mode of discovery**.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Double-Edged Tool**  
> Paraphrase promises clarity but risks simplification. It reveals what we value in a text: when we paraphrase, we decide what counts as its “meaning.” Thus, paraphrase is never neutral; it is an act of interpretation that shows our own critical priorities.  

---

## I. Ancient and Early Modern Origins

### Quintilian: Paraphrase as Rhetorical Rivalry  
In *Institutio Oratoria* (c. 95 CE), **Quintilian** urged students to paraphrase verse to improve oratory. The task was not mere imitation but competition:  

> “Its duty is rather to rival and vie with the original in the expression of the same thoughts.”:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  

Here, paraphrase is **a form of creative rivalry** — turning poetry into prose, not to simplify but to elevate rhetoric through poetic vigor. The paraphrast competes with the poet as a craftsman of style.

### Erasmus and Udall: Paraphrase as Illumination  
A millennium later, paraphrase served scripture. Nicholas **Udall**, in his 1548 preface to the *Paraphrase of Erasmus upon the New Testament*, defined it as:  

> “A plain setting forth of a text … with such circumstance of more and other words, as may make the sentence open, clear, plain, and familiar.”:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

For Udall, paraphrase was **pedagogical and devotional**: to “open” obscurity and make divine truth accessible.  

> **Mini-Essay — From Rivalry to Reverence**  
> Between Quintilian and Udall, paraphrase shifts from **rhetorical competition** to **didactic humility**. Where Quintilian’s paraphrast vies with the poet, Udall’s paraphrast serves the Word. In both, however, language mediates power — whether of persuasion or of God.

## II. The Classical Anxiety: Can the Best Be Improved?

### Dryden and the Refinement of Shakespeare  
John **Dryden**, in his *Preface to Troilus and Cressida* (1679), claims to “remove the heap of rubbish” from Shakespeare’s coarseness and “figurative obscurity.” His paraphrase seeks refinement, turning “rubbish” into reason.  

Yet this rationalising zeal exposes paraphrase’s arrogance: to think one can “say better than that which is best.” **Roger Ascham** (1570) mocked such attempts as “turning good wine into a musty bottle of leather.”:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

### Shakespeare “Made Easy” — and Made Dull  
McGhee’s lecture contrasts Shakespeare’s  
> “Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,”  
with its “modern” paraphrase:  
> “That’s why our intelligence makes us all cowards.”  

This flattening of tone and metaphor demonstrates how paraphrase drains the **form of meaning**. “Coward” loses its moral bite; “sicklied o’er” becomes “takes on a sickly pallor,” clinical and bloodless.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Poverty of Substitution**  
> The paraphrast believes that meaning lies in content, not in form — that words merely *contain* ideas. But as Shakespeare shows, meaning inheres in sound, rhythm, and metaphor. When paraphrase forgets this, it mistakes poetry for prose and thought for information.  

---

## III. The Romantic Challenge: The Inseparability of Form and Meaning

### Coleridge: “Untranslatableness Without Injury”  
Samuel Taylor **Coleridge**, in *Biographia Literaria* (1817), argued that in great writing — Milton or Shakespeare — one cannot alter “a word or the position of a word… without making the author say something else or something worse.”:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

He extends meaning beyond denotation:  
> “Language is framed to convey not the object alone, but likewise the character, mood, and intentions of the person who is representing it.”  

Paraphrase fails because it assumes meaning is detachable; Coleridge insists that **sound, syntax, and feeling** are inseparable.

### Al-Jurjani and the Image of Meaning  
Long before Coleridge, the Persian grammarian **Abd al-Qahir al-Jurjani** (11th c.) made the same point. Beauty in language, he wrote, arises from three inseparable elements: idea, word, and arrangement — *surat al-maʿna*, “the form of meaning.”:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

> **Mini-Essay — Form as Thought**  
> Both Coleridge and al-Jurjani reject the “container” model of language. Form is not the vessel of meaning but its manifestation. Paraphrase, by treating words as replaceable, mistakes transformation for translation.

## IV. Resistance as a Mark of Literary Value

### Mandelstam and the “Rumpled Sheets”  
The Russian poet **Osip Mandelstam** quipped:  
> “Where one finds commensurability with paraphrase, there poetry has not, so to speak, spent the night.”  

The metaphor of “rumpled sheets” — poetry’s lived intensity — captures what later critics like **Cleanth Brooks** would call “the resistance which any good poem sets up against all attempts to paraphrase it.”  

Paraphrase becomes the **foil** against which poetic vitality defines itself.  

### Yet the Counterexample: Bad Poems Resist Too  
McGhee humorously turns to John Close’s *“And Have We Lost Another Friend?”* (1860) — a poem of solemn bathos. Its clumsy earnestness (“Hark to the tolling bell!”) shows that even *bad* poems resist paraphrase. Their faults — tone, rhythm, emotional misfires — can only be felt, not summarized.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Paradox of Resistance**  
> Paraphrase-resistance is not proof of greatness. Even mediocrity can be “unparaphrasable.” What matters is not whether paraphrase fails, but *how* and *why* it fails — what that failure teaches about the work’s texture of meaning.  

---

## V. Paraphrase as Discovery

### The Critical Turn: From Brooks to Empson  
Cleanth **Brooks** warned against “the heresy of paraphrase,” insisting that paraphrase reduces poetry’s complexity to “the real core of meaning.” Yet as McGhee observes, Brooks inadvertently repeats the same error — assuming meaning has a hidden “core” apart from form.  

**A.C. Bradley** corrected this dualism:  
> “You can no more separate form and substance than you can separate living blood and the life in the blood.”  

Meaning *is* form-in-motion, “the order of disclosure upon which the poem depends” (George Oppen).  

### William Empson: Paraphrase as Experiment  
In *Seven Types of Ambiguity* (1930), **Empson** rehabilitates paraphrase as an analytic tool. His elaborate expansions of a simple lyric —  

> “Cupid is winged and doth range;  
> Her country so my love doth change” —  

produce a kaleidoscope of interpretations (“I will love her though she moves to another planet… though she kills me”). Paraphrase, here, does not simplify but **exfoliates ambiguity**.  

> **Mini-Essay — Paraphrase as Performance**  
> Empson’s paraphrase is not explanatory but performative. By restating the line through multiple voices, he dramatizes the poem’s shifting possibilities. Paraphrase becomes a mode of thinking *with* the poem, not over it.  

---

## VI. Language, Tone, and the Printed Voice

### The Problem of Tone  
**John Keats** lamented that “one cannot write a wink, or a nod, or a grin.” Yet in the very act of writing, he conjures a lively presence through language alone — the paradox of tone in print.  

Similarly, **George Eliot** in *Middlemarch* analyses the line “What can I do, Tertius?”: its four words can express anything from devotion to disdain, depending on intonation. In print, tone becomes a space of interpretive play.  

### Eric Griffiths: The Silent Voice of Print  
Griffiths, in *The Printed Voice of Victorian Poetry* (1989), argues that this ambiguity is poetry’s strength. Because “we don’t know exactly how he sounds, we can’t know exactly how he feels,” the reader must imagine tone. Paraphrase, by contrast, collapses this openness into decision.  

His reading of Tennyson’s *“Vastness”* shows this vividly:  
> “Peace, let it be! for I loved him, and love him for ever: the dead are not dead but alive.”  
The line’s serenity or despair depends on how one reads it — an ambiguity no paraphrase can capture.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Imagination of Absence**  
> Griffiths teaches us to *imagine the unsaid*. The power of literature lies not in what can be stated but in what must be *precisely imagined*. Paraphrase fails not because it says too little, but because it says *too much*.  

---

## VII. The Uses and Limits of Paraphrase

Paraphrase can simplify or illuminate depending on how it’s used. As **Peter Lamarque** notes, “specifications of what a poem is ‘about’ come in degrees of fine-grainedness.” We paraphrase differently depending on purpose — a headline need not a sonnet’s precision.  

But when paraphrase seeks to reproduce a poem’s *total effect*, **Peter Kivy** warns, it attempts the impossible: it demands equivalence of experience rather than clarity of content.  

> **Mini-Essay — Knowing What We Are Doing**  
> The critic’s task is not to avoid paraphrase, but to use it knowingly. A paraphrase is a *pointer*, not a replacement. It can guide attention, open interpretation, or test understanding — so long as we remember that the poem exceeds it.  

---

## VIII. Paraphrase and Value

### Intrinsic Value and the Living Text  
**A.C. Bradley** argued that poetry’s value lies in its unity of form and meaning: it is “an end in itself.” To treat literature as information is to strip it of its life.  

**John Wilkinson** extends this idea: “Poems live… they are entities sponsoring life in their readers.” **Michel Chaouli** warns that when criticism treats art as data to be “interrogated,” it risks avoidance rather than engagement.  

> **Mini-Essay — Paraphrase as Ethical Reading**  
> To paraphrase well is to *listen* well — to attend to tone, ambiguity, rhythm. Used responsibly, paraphrase can sharpen ethical and aesthetic perception, keeping criticism “answerable to fine-grained games of meaning.”  

---

## IX. Conclusion: Paraphrase as Critical Practice  

McGhee ends by reclaiming paraphrase as an instrument not of reduction but of imagination. When wielded carefully, it clarifies our reading and exposes our assumptions. When wielded crudely, it flattens literature into “information.”  

> “Criticism,” writes Michel Chaouli, “is not a record of an experience that lies in the past… it is the arena for developing the experience.”  

To paraphrase, then, is to participate in that arena — to test our understanding against the language we love.  

> **Mini-Essay — Beyond the Heresy**  
> The real “heresy” is not paraphrase itself but **forgetting why we read**. To translate poetry into prose, to render tone into thought, is an exercise in humility. It reminds us that meaning is not possessed but pursued — a dialogue between language and life.

## Motif Tracker  

| **Motif** | **Example(s)** | **Interpretive Use** |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Form = Meaning** | Coleridge, al-Jurjani | The indivisibility of style and sense; paraphrase as distortion. |
| **Resistance / Untranslatability** | Mandelstam, Brooks | Defines “literariness” through what cannot be restated. |
| **Voice and Tone** | Keats, Eliot, Griffiths | Paraphrase cannot capture tonal indeterminacy. |
| **Ambiguity** | Empson’s *Cupid* reading | Paraphrase as method of expansion, not reduction. |
| **Paraphrase as Critique** | McGhee’s Shakespeare examples | Reveals cultural assumptions about clarity and taste. |
| **Living Language** | Bradley, Wilkinson | Literature as vitality; criticism as engagement. |

---

## Critical Lenses  

| **Axis** | **Relationship** | **Implication** |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Form ↔ Content** | Inseparable unity (Bradley, Coleridge) | Paraphrase neglects the dynamic of language. |
| **Voice ↔ Silence** | Print creates ambiguity (Griffiths) | Reader imagines tone; paraphrase overspecifies. |
| **Meaning ↔ Experience** | Empson and Phillips | Literature as emotional discovery, not transmission. |
| **Criticism ↔ Creation** | Chaouli’s “arena” | Reading and writing are interdependent acts. |
| **Paraphrase ↔ Interpretation** | McGhee’s pedagogy | Knowing use transforms paraphrase into insight. |

## Exam Relevance — Oxford Prelims Paper 1B  

### Core Skills  
- Distinguishing **form, content, and tone** in close reading.  
- Using paraphrase to test understanding without reducing complexity.  
- Recognising how **meaning emerges through language**, not behind it.  

### Model Essay Patterns  
1. **“The Heresy Revisited”** — Evaluate Brooks’s claim through a close reading that resists summary.  
2. **“Paraphrase as Discovery”** — Use Empson or Griffiths to show paraphrase expanding meaning.  
3. **“From Quintilian to Coleridge”** — Trace how theories of paraphrase reveal changing ideas of language and value.  

### Revision Strategies  
- Practise paraphrasing complex lines *and* explaining what is lost.  
- Compare paraphrase-friendly prose (e.g., sermons, journalism) with paraphrase-resistant poetry.  
- Read aloud: test how rhythm and tone carry meaning that paraphrase cannot.
