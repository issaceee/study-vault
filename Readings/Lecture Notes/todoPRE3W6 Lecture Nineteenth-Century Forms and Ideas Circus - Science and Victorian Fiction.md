# Own Notes

ideas from science embedded in fiction in deep levels 
- manifest in specific diction and words

why consider them tgt
- science provides us w concepts for ordering the world
	- natural history is also narrative-esque
- so does narrative - borrows or mimics scientific concepts

* * scientific ideas inform narrative form (the shape texts take and also its narrative)

methodological
scinece tends to enter a scientific romance differently from realism
- science fiction creates an alternative realtive - acknowledgment that something is different about its world - novum

reality of the novel is continuous with the reader's novel
- middlemrch is a fictitious town but resembles a victorian town (realist)
	- scientific ideas rather than being explicitly transformative, they ripple under the surface, the unconscious of the text (textual unconscious - ONLY for realism texts)
		- George Elliot was vv well versed with scientific texts
		- Dorotheo grows new organs figuratively as an index of her transformed life and new reality (ch. 50 - "stirring of new organs")


science deals solely in facts and literature deals with feelings?
- no

scientists too are creative thinkers - their thinking involves analogy and metaphore

science vs religion

pluraity of sciences as well as religion


specialisation and inaccessibility
- 19th century it was possible to range more widely across the sciences
- possible to write in a non-specialised language as well
	- Gillian Beer, *Darwin's Plots* (1983), pp. 6-7
		- scientific texts could be read very much as literary texts.
		- scientists .... drew openly upon literary, historical and philosophical material
		- traffic, then, was two-way.
			- non-scientific influences impinging on the scientist (immersed in society at the time)

science only accessible at the cost of being misunderstood
- how do we gauge the creative reqorking of a science?
- while its useful to compare the account of scientist and that of novelists
	- we should look at why did they get it wrong, why did they reshape it/reqork it


analogy and metaphor
- thermodynamics
	- 



* * metaphor as a tool of thought (not as something to dress an idea up)
	* express new understandings using something familiar (comparing one domain of thought w another)


traces of culture in Darwin's theory
- Malthus: belief that scarcity and competition was a fact for life for humans
- Darwin --> selective pressures --> natural selection
	- Karl Marx, letter 1862: Darwin rediscovers, among the beasts and plants, the society of England, with its division of labour, competition, openng up of new markets, 'inventions' and the Multhusian 'struggle for existence'
- 

* * verbal traces of scientific ideas
	* 


prelude to middle march (3rd para):
- "limits of variation" // ch. 1 Variation under DOmestication // ch. 2 Variation under Nature


* * reading victorian fiction for the FORM that the story takes
	* narratorial emphasis


uniformitarianism vs catastrophism
- elliots narrator is reminding us of stuff that we missed (ch. 11)
	- moments of wills being read, suspect deaths and so forth, world of melodrama uderneath it but attempt to narrate something that isnt melodrama


thermodynamics - energy and entropy
- dominance of coal-powered technologies (steam - heat into movement)
- entropy as always tending towards increase

* "dissipation, flows, running down (spring, boiler, sun etc.)
* * dialogue on energy allows various entitties to be perceived as if they are leaky steam energies
	* sun as a leaky engine where energy is always leaking out
	* human bodies as having a finite easily depleted source of energy
		* sex-based (patriarchy, men as having more than women, women spend more easily, women need to save it for childbirth) --> language of scientific used to assert cultural ideologies
	* decline irreversibility and disorder --> biblical temples(?) - not waste anything given to you

- dissipation - physical and moral domains

is a moral concept drawn into physics or physics drawn into moral judgment?

sun being red
- sunset?
- finite lifespan of sun/time on earth
	- Conrads' Heart of Darkness, ch. 1
		- "the sun sank low...."
		- idea of heat death --> novels concern with efficiency then takes on a diff set of resonances (bleak house: blocked flows, wasteful expenditure etc.)

unseen universe (where the dead go)


changes authority of science

influence of science on literature can take a long time to process
- by the time its moved into diff cultures it might take different symbolisms
	- entrop 1906 - gloomy; 1960s california - groovy
