## Literary Worlds: Rabindranath Tagore and the Idea of World Literature

---

## Introduction: Tagore’s Worlds and Ours

Rabindranath Tagore (1861–1941) occupies a unique space in literary history — the first writer from beyond Europe to win the Nobel Prize in Literature (1913), a poet, philosopher, painter, musician, and political thinker whose life spanned the full arc of British imperial power in India. His career embodies what the lecture calls a “myriad-minded” imagination, as the 1940 Oxford oration put it: “the fervent upholder of learning and sound doctrine, the ardent defender of public liberties… one who by the sanctity of his life and character has won for himself the praise of all mankind” (Oxford Oration 1940).

But Tagore’s true importance for modern literary studies lies in the way he **redefines both “literature” and “world literature.”** For Oxford students of Paper 3 (Literature in English 1830–1910), he stands at the threshold between the national and the global, the romantic and the modern, the colonial and the postcolonial. His world is both his home and the world — to borrow the phrase of the medieval Bengali poet Chandidas that Tagore made his own: “I have made the world my home / And my home the world” (Tagore, *Gitanjali* 1913).

> **Mini-Essay — Tagore’s Double Vision**  
> Tagore’s “world” is never a geopolitical map but a mode of consciousness. The world is created each time a poet thinks beyond the boundaries of nation or language. His literary humanism is not universalism in the abstract, but a *relational vision* — a ceaseless negotiation between self and other, home and elsewhere. Every act of reading, he suggests, remakes the world.

## Context: Empire and the Life of a Poet

Born in 1861 in Calcutta, Tagore grew up in a family central to Bengal’s cultural revival. Three years earlier, British rule had formally transferred from the East India Company to the Crown — the founding of the British Raj. When he died in 1941, India was on the brink of independence. His life thus traces the parenthesis of High Empire (McDonald 2025).

Tagore was both **participant and critic** of empire: willing to engage British culture and Oxford intellectual life, yet uncompromisingly anti-colonial. He founded *Visva-Bharati University* (1921) as an “alternative, anti-colonial university in Bengal” — a name meaning “India in the world,” or “world in India.” That double preposition defines his entire project.

> **Mini-Essay — Context as Harassment**  
> As Peter McDonald emphasises, context for Tagore was never mere background but a form of “harassment” — a pressure that compelled him to write. Empire, nationalism, and cosmopolitanism were not academic categories but living forces that demanded an answer. His literature is thus an act of resistance: a refusal to let history define the limits of imagination (McDonald 2025).

## The Essence of Literature (1889)

In an essay titled “Literature” (1889), published in his family’s Bengali magazine, Tagore begins with a startling claim: “The essence of literature does not allow itself to be trapped within a definition” (Tagore 1889).

This is a radical statement for its time. It anticipates — by several decades — modern European theories of *literariness* (from Blanchot to Barthes) that define literature by its resistance to definition. In 1889, before English departments existed in India or even fully at Oxford, Tagore had already articulated the principle that **literature is uncontainable** — an open process rather than a closed category.

He distinguishes between **construction** (the deliberate, self-conscious making of a text) and **creation** (the spontaneous act that exceeds intention). This distinction prefigures twentieth-century debates on authorship, from Romantic inspiration to poststructuralist “death of the author.”

> **Mini-Essay — The Uncontainable Word**  
> For Tagore, the creative act cannot be subsumed under scholarly classification. Every definition of literature is provisional, because writers perpetually rewrite its boundaries. “As soon as you have a definition,” he implies, “someone will write something that defeats it.” Literature is thus not an object but an event — a continual becoming (Tagore 1889).

## From National Character to World Consciousness

When English literature was first institutionalised at Oxford in the 1890s, it was framed by what William John Courthope called the “Law of National Character.” In *Life in Poetry: Law in Taste* (1901), Courthope argued that, besides Aristotle’s universal law of art, there exists “another law… the social instinct which compels the artist to individualise his idea of the universal in the light of the race tendencies and character of the nation to which he belongs” (Courthope 1901).

This vision — of literature as expression of a **national spirit** — dominated late-Victorian thought. It defined English Studies as a patriotic project, making literary study the moral education of citizens. The Oxford curriculum, as McDonald notes, “was only successfully denationalised in 2012” (McDonald 2025).

Tagore’s intervention begins as a challenge to this entire epistemology. Writing from colonial Bengal, he rejected both imperial universalism and nationalist particularism. His essays of the 1900s — especially “World Literature” (1907) — redefine literature as the space where the **local and the global continually reconfigure one another** (Tagore 1907).

> **Mini-Essay — Against the Ploughed Fields**  
> Tagore’s metaphor for world literature rejects the additive logic of comparative studies: “The world is not your ploughed field plus my ploughed field.” Each genuine work of art generates its own “world,” not by summing cultures but by transforming them. The act of creation dissolves borders rather than accumulating them (Tagore 1907).

## European Precursors: Goethe, Schlegel, and Marx

The idea of *Weltliteratur* — world literature — had European precedents. Friedrich Schlegel urged in 1808 that we view “the literature of all civilised peoples as one entire system” (Schlegel 1808). Goethe, in 1827, famously declared that “National literature is now a rather unmeaning term; the epoch of world literature is at hand” (Goethe 1827).

Yet both thinkers conceived world literature as a **humanist ideal**, a universal canon to be shared among nations. Marx and Engels, by contrast, described it as the product of economic modernity: “From the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature” (Marx & Engels 1848).

For them, world literature was a by-product of capitalism’s “universal inter-dependence of nations.” Tagore knew both traditions but **refused both**. He transformed *Weltliteratur* from a Eurocentric narrative of exchange into an ongoing practice of ethical imagination (Tagore 1907; Chaudhuri 2013).

> **Mini-Essay — The World Not Yet Made**  
> Tagore’s world literature is not a catalogue of texts but a moral and creative process. Where Marx saw global capitalism as the engine of interconnection, Tagore saw **imagination** as the true agent of relation. His “world” is not an achieved totality but a continuous aspiration — a humanity still in the making (Tagore 1907; Chaudhuri 2018).

---

## “World Literature” (1907): The Universal in the Particular

In his 1907 lecture “World Literature,” delivered in Bengali to an audience of Indian scholars, Tagore redefines the very term. He resists the colonial drive to classify and compare literatures by nation. Instead, he imagines a literature of **interrelation** and **mutual recognition**.

The 2001 translation renders the key passage as: “It is time we pledged that our goal is to view universal humanity in universal literature… that we shall recognise a totality in each particular author’s work, and that in this totality we shall perceive the interrelations among all human efforts at expression” (Tagore 1907; trans. Chaudhuri 2001).

Rosinka Chaudhuri’s later commentary (2018) sharpens this insight: “The time has come to try to free ourselves from narrow parochialism and to aim to see the World-Man (viśva mānab) within the world of literature; to find in the works of particular writers a whole, and in that whole the interrelations among all forms of human expression” (Chaudhuri 2018).

This distinction between *totality* and *whole* is crucial. The totality implies a closed, finished system; the whole, by contrast, is **organic and incomplete**, always open to new relations.

> **Mini-Essay — The World-Man**  
> The Bengali concept *viśva mānab* (“world-man”) expresses Tagore’s alternative to both cosmopolitanism and nationalism. It names a being who is simultaneously rooted and open — one who recognises the “interrelations among all forms of human expression.” Literature becomes the medium through which we encounter this figure, in ourselves and in others (Tagore 1907; Chaudhuri 2018).

---

## Knowing the Other as the Self

Tagore’s ethics of literature is captured in a line he borrowed from the fourteenth-century poet Chandidas: “It is nothing but knowing others as our own, and ourselves as other” (Tagore, cited in Chaudhuri 2013).

This paradox summarises Tagore’s vision of the world as reciprocal transformation. In every act of reading, the reader becomes other to themselves; in every act of writing, the writer becomes world. This dynamic relation anticipates later phenomenological and postcolonial theories of self and alterity (Tagore 1907; Chaudhuri 2013).

> **Mini-Essay — Translation as Ethics**  
> Translation, for Tagore, is not the reproduction of content but the creation of relation. Each translation is a new act of world-making, a renewal of the possibility of understanding. His own self-translations from Bengali into English were imperfect, but they dramatise this principle: to translate is to inhabit both self and other at once (Tagore 1913; Chaudhuri 2013).

---

## Against the “Spiritualist” Misreading

Western critics have often reduced Tagore to an “Eastern mystic,” a guru of universal brotherhood. Pheng Cheah calls this “the older spiritualist vision of world literature,” inherited from Goethe’s idealism (Cheah 2016). Yet, as Amit Chaudhuri insists, Tagore’s thought “constantly refutes metaphysics — a system whereby value and meaning have their source elsewhere, beyond the experienced world” (A. Chaudhuri 2018).

Tagore’s universalism is not transcendental but **experiential**. The divine or the “universal man” is not above the world but within it — an aspiration toward fullness grounded in the here and now (Tagore 1913; Chaudhuri 2018).

> **Mini-Essay — The Immanent Universal**  
> Tagore’s “universal man” is not a god but a task: to make the local luminous, to see the infinite within the finite. In this, he shares affinities with late Romantic and modernist thought — Wordsworth’s “sense sublime of something far more deeply interfused,” or Joyce’s “epiphany.” Yet Tagore insists that such vision arises not from isolation but from relation: the world remade through encounter (Tagore 1913; Chaudhuri 2013).

---

## The Poetic Vision: *Gitanjali* and Beyond

Tagore’s *Gitanjali* (1910; Eng. trans. 1913) embodies this ethos. A poem from the English *Song Offerings* reads:

> “Gentle in this hallowed place / Wake up, O my mind, on this seashore…  
> Here I stand and stretch my arms, saluting / The universal man, the god in man” (Tagore, *Gitanjali* 1913).

The scene is local — the Indian seashore — yet it opens into an oceanic vision of humanity. The poem’s gesture (“stretch my arms”) becomes symbolic of Tagore’s entire poetics: an embrace of life, chance, and play (Tagore 1913).

> **Mini-Essay — The Oceanic Imagination**  
> In Tagore’s poetics, locality and universality are not opposites but rhythms of the same movement. The seashore marks the threshold where the personal meets the planetary. To write from this edge is to acknowledge both rootedness and permeability — to make the world one’s home, and one’s home the world (Tagore 1913; Chaudhuri 2018).

---

## The Dialogue with the West: Arnold and the Gita

The lecture closes by tracing reverse influences: how nineteenth-century English writers engaged Indian thought. Matthew Arnold’s *Empedocles on Etna* (1852) and his published letters on the *Bhagavad-Gītā* (1848) reveal a fascination with Indian ideas of renunciation and knowledge (Arnold 1852; Arnold 1848). Arnold’s distinction between “practice,” “meditation,” and “renunciation of action” echoes the spiritual dialectics that Tagore inherited and transformed (Arnold 1852; Tagore 1907).

To read Arnold and Tagore together is to see the **mutual permeability of literary worlds**. The so-called “English tradition” has always been already global — shaped by its encounters with Sanskrit philosophy, Persian poetics, and Bengali song. Tagore thus stands not outside the canon but within its most vital conversations (Arnold 1852; Tagore 1907).

## Exam Relevance

### For Oxford Prelims Paper 3 (1830–1910)

- Demonstrates the transition from **Victorian national paradigms** to **global literary consciousness** (Courthope 1901; Tagore 1907).  
- Illustrates how **form, philosophy, and empire** intersect in late nineteenth-century thought (Tagore 1889; McDonald 2025).  
- Offers a case study in **comparative reading**, uniting European and Indian intellectual traditions (Goethe 1827; Tagore 1907).  

### Core Analytical Skills

- Ability to connect **textual detail with conceptual frameworks** (form ↔ idea).  
- Sensitivity to **translation, mediation, and reception history** (Tagore 1913; Chaudhuri 2018).  
- Understanding of how **colonial context shapes literary form and theory** (McDonald 2025).

### Model Essay Patterns

1. **“From Nation to World”** — Compare Courthope’s national poetics with Tagore’s universalism. (Courthope 1901; Tagore 1907)  
2. **“The Uncontainable Text”** — Discuss how Tagore’s 1889 “Literature” anticipates modern literary theory. (Tagore 1889)  
3. **“World Literature and Empire”** — Analyse how colonial contexts transform global aesthetic ideas. (Tagore 1907; McDonald 2025)

### Revision Strategies

- Read Tagore alongside Goethe, Arnold, and Marx to trace evolving definitions of “world literature.” (Goethe 1827; Marx & Engels 1848)  
- Reflect on how literary institutions (like Oxford’s) historically framed literature in national terms. (Courthope 1901; McDonald 2025)  
- Practice integrating **theoretical reflection with close reading** — Tagore’s prose and poetry invite both (Tagore 1889; Tagore 1913).

## Conclusion: The World Yet to Come

For Tagore, literature’s highest task is not representation but **relation**. To write or read is to enter into a process of becoming-world — a process without closure. His vision anticipates the postcolonial and global turns in literary studies by nearly a century (Tagore 1907; Chaudhuri 2018).

In his words and his life, Tagore models a practice of *worldliness* that is neither imperial nor cosmopolitan in the Western sense, but something more radical: a poetics of **belonging without possession**.

> **Mini-Essay — The Unfinished World**  
> The “world” of world literature is not a pre-existing unity but a verb: *worlding*. Each poem, each encounter, remakes the possible. To study Tagore today is to recognise that the humanities themselves are this kind of open project — not the mastery of knowledge, but the art of learning to live with others (Tagore 1907; Chaudhuri 2018).
