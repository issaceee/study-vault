## Introduction: The Problem of Context  

Professor **Joe Moshenska** begins with a thought experiment: imagine that one of your own writings — a diary, an essay, even a note — is discovered centuries in the future. Scholars of that future, desperate for traces of the early twenty-first century, pore over every sentence as evidence of its age.  

But what would count as your “context”? Your education, gender, language? The climate crisis? The internet age? Or things you yourself never noticed shaping your thought? (Moshenska 2025).

> **Mini-Essay — The Mirage of Context**  
> “Context” feels like a bridge between text and history, but it often hides what it claims to reveal. To *put* a work “in context” assumes that the text is inert, waiting to be contained by its background. Moshenska’s thought experiment exposes the fiction of containment: context is not a tub for margarine, but a web of invisible forces — many of which the writer never perceives (Moshenska 2025).

### The Double Meaning of “Context”  

The Oxford English Dictionary traces *context* to the Latin *contextus* — “that which is woven together.” Originally, it referred to **the relations within a text**, not its surroundings. Over time, the word’s sense flipped outward: from the inner weave of a text to the external network around it. Literature, however, still operates in both senses — as a tissue of interrelations within itself and with history.

> **Mini-Essay — The Text as Its Own Context**  
> Every work of art is both container and contained. The texture of its language, its repetitions, and silences form a history of their own — not commentary upon the world but sediment of it. To read contextually, then, is also to read **the history within form** (Felski 2015).

## I. Scales of Context  

Moshenska asks: how large or small can context be?  
- **Micro**: biographical details — age, gender, class.  
- **Meso**: institutions — the university, the city, the nation.  
- **Macro**: historical epochs — capitalism, empire, “the internet age.”  

A writer may be unaware of these frameworks, yet they structure her imagination. Contexts are always **multiple** and **partly unconscious**. The author is not necessarily “the best arbiter” of her own contexts (Jameson 1981).

## II. Always Historicise! — Fredric Jameson  

Fredric Jameson’s dictum from *The Political Unconscious* (1981) provides a rallying cry: **“Always historicise!”** Yet, as Jameson argues, historicising can proceed along **two paths**: (Jameson 1981):  
1. **The path of the object** — the historical origins of a text’s forms and contents.  
2. **The path of the subject** — the historical origins of our interpretive categories themselves.  

The second path radicalises the first: *our very ways of reading are historical.* Thought itself has a history.

> **Mini-Essay — The Historicity of Understanding**  
> To read historically is not merely to reconstruct a vanished world but to recognise that our own minds belong to history. Interpretation is itself an event in time — part of the story literature tells about how humans make meaning (Jameson 1981).

## III. From New Criticism to New Historicism  

### The Reaction Against Autonomy  

The **New Critics** (e.g. Cleanth Brooks, W.K. Wimsatt, R.P. Blackmur) treated poems as self-contained “well-wrought urns.” New Historicists rejected this autonomy, insisting that texts are **sites of social energy** rather than sealed aesthetic objects (Brooks 1947).

### Stephen Greenblatt and the “Circulation of Social Energy”  

Stephen Greenblatt’s work reframes literary texts as participants in cultural flows — political, religious, economic — a project most concentratedly argued in *Shakespearean Negotiations* (1988) and Practicing New Historicism (Greenblatt 1988; Gallagher & Greenblatt 2000).

His essay “Invisible Bullets” begins not with Shakespeare but with a spy’s note reporting Marlowe’s heresies; from there he links Elizabethan espionage, exploration, and theatrical politics in a series of associative readings (Greenblatt 1988).

> **Mini-Essay — The Anecdote as Method**  
> The anecdote embodies the New Historicist belief that history’s meaning is dispersed, not hierarchical. A court record, a travel diary, a play: all transmit the same “social energy.” The critic’s task is to trace these invisible currents rather than to prove causation (Gallagher & Greenblatt 2000).

### Limits of the Method  

Moshenska notes that this levelling of text and context sometimes re-established old hierarchies: canonical authors (Shakespeare above others) remained central, and broad claims about cultural “circulation” risk reproducing the periodisation New Historicism claimed to critique (Moshenska 2025; Greenblatt 1988).

## IV. Beyond the Period: Rethinking Temporality  

Recent theory unsettles the very notion of linear, unified time.

### Michel Serres — The Polychronic World  

Michel Serres describes historical eras as **multitemporal**; objects and texts gather together obsolete, contemporary, and future strands — a “folded” or pleated temporality that resists linear chronology (Serres 1995).

> “Every historical era is multitemporal, simultaneously drawing from the obsolete, the contemporary, and the futuristic… an object is thus polychronic, multitemporal, and reveals a time that is gathered together, with multiple pleats.” (Serres 1995)

Time, for Serres, is not a line but a **folded fabric**. Literature embodies this folding — carrying past and future within its present.

### Bruno Latour — We Have Never Been Modern  

Bruno Latour extends this insight in *We Have Never Been Modern* (1993): modern temporality is the product of a disciplinary separation that flattens heterogeneous times into a single historical frame. Once we recognise “quasi-objects” (hybrids of categories), the neat order of historical periodisation unravels (Latour 1993).

> **Mini-Essay — The Pleated Present**  
> To read a text as “of its time” is already to repress the anachronisms it carries. A poem is never modern or medieval alone; it folds many moments into one. The act of reading unfolds those pleats, releasing the future hidden in the past (Latour 1993; Serres 1995).

### Queer Temporalities  

Elizabeth Freeman’s *Time Binds* (2010) and Carolyn Dinshaw’s *How Soon Is Now?* (2007/2012) bring these temporal critiques into contact with queer theory: Freeman coins **chrononormativity** to name how social life is structured by normative temporal schedules (marriage, reproduction, career), while Dinshaw celebrates **queer anachronism** that refuses tidy historical sequencing (Freeman 2010; Dinshaw 2012).

These approaches make temporality itself a political and aesthetic question.

### Rita Felski — The Busy Afterlife of the Text  

Rita Felski has reminded critics that the literary artefact has a busy afterlife that repeatedly reactivates meanings and resists being neatly boxed into its original moment: “The busy afterlife of the literary artefact refutes our efforts to box it into a moment of origin” (Felski 2015).

> **Mini-Essay — The Text as Temporal Actor**  
> Literature does not merely belong to history; it *makes* history. Each reading reactivates the work’s potential energies. The poem survives not as residue of the past but as participant in the present — and architect of future meanings (Felski 2015; Freeman 2010).

---

## V. Case Study: John Donne’s *“The Relic”*  

To illustrate these theories, Moshenska turns to Donne’s *The Relic* (c.1611) — a poem obsessed with time, resurrection, and misrecognition.

> *“When my grave is broke up again, / Some second guest to entertain…”* (Donne, *The Relic*)

The speaker imagines his bones exhumed, mistaken for saintly relics. Donne’s conceit fuses the **earthly and eternal**, the **sacred and profane**. Historically, relics were contested in post-Reformation England; Donne, who converted from Anglicanism to Catholic-adjacent practices before his Anglican ordination, knew the religious stakes. A historicist reading is valuable, but the poem also stages a deeper **temporal experiment**.

Relics themselves are *objects out of time* — decayed matter imbued with new significance. Donne’s poem mimics this paradox: it survives as a relic of language, a body of words animated by successive readers (Donne c.1611).

> **Mini-Essay — The Poem as Relic**  
> *The Relic* enacts what it describes. It is unearthed by each generation, reinterpreted, mistaken, adored. Its temporality is “pleated”: future, present, and past intertwine. To read it is to take part in the miracle of its misrecognition (Donne c.1611; Serres 1995).

Donne’s later prose (*Devotions upon Emergent Occasions*, 1624) makes this temporal anxiety explicit: “Before you sound that word *present*, or that monosyllable *now*, the present and the now is past” (Donne 1624). For Donne, as for Serres, time itself is unstable — a vanishing instant.

---

## VI. Conclusion: Literature as Multitemporal Thought  

To “historicise” is not to trap a work in its past but to perceive its **movement through time**. A literary text is a **polychronic artefact**: it contains the residues of its origins, the transformations of its readers, and the futures it continues to invent.

> **Mini-Essay — Reading in Deep Time**  
> The act of reading is itself historical. When we study Donne, we are not returning to 1611 but creating a new intersection of moments — his, ours, and those to come. Literature and history are not separate disciplines but intertwined modes of thinking temporally (Jameson 1981; Serres 1995; Felski 2015).

## Motif Tracker  

| **Motif** | **Example(s)** | **Interpretive Use** |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Context / Text** | Milton’s notion of sacred textuality; modern theorists | Context as both internal texture and external network. |
| **Historicising** | Jameson’s “two paths” | Reading as historical action; the critic as subject of history. |
| **Social Energy** | Greenblatt’s *Shakespearean Negotiations* | Literature as participant in cultural power. |
| **Polychronic Time** | Serres, Latour, Donne | Texts as multi-temporal folds, not linear products. |
| **Chrononormativity** | Freeman, Dinshaw | Temporal order as social discipline; anachronism as resistance. |
| **Afterlife** | Felski’s “busy afterlife” | The text’s continued agency beyond its origin. |

---

## Critical Lenses  

| **Axis** | **Relationship** | **Implication** |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Text ↔ Context** | Interwoven, not hierarchical | Context exists inside the work (Felski 2015). |
| **Past ↔ Future** | Time as pleated, recursive | Literature creates as well as records history (Serres 1995). |
| **Form ↔ History** | Form carries historical consciousness | Style as historical document (Jameson 1981). |
| **Reader ↔ Text** | Reading as historical encounter | Every interpretation reconfigures temporality (Dinshaw 2012). |
| **Subject ↔ Object** | Both historically constituted | Criticism is itself a historical act (Gallagher & Greenblatt 2000). |

## Exam Relevance  

**For Paper 1B (Introduction to Literature and History):**  
- Develops conceptual precision about *context*, *periodisation*, and *temporality*.  
- Encourages critical reflection on what it means to “put a text in context.”  
- Provides frameworks for analysing historical theory (Jameson, Greenblatt, Serres, Latour, Felski).

### Model Essay Patterns  
1. **“Always historicise!”** — Discuss Jameson’s two paths of historicising and their implications for literary study (Jameson 1981).  
2. **“Every historical era is multitemporal.”** — Explore Serres and Latour through a reading of Donne’s *The Relic* (Serres 1995; Latour 1993; Donne c.1611).  
3. **“The busy afterlife of the literary artefact refutes our efforts to box it into a moment of origin.”** — Evaluate Felski’s claim using examples from premodern or modern texts (Felski 2015).
