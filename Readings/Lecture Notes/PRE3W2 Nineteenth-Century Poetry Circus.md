# The Dramatic Monologue (or, Robert Browning's Hearing')

![[Victorian Poetry Circus Dramatic Monologue Ratcliffe Handout.pdf]]

- dramatic monolgue
	- poem spoken by character who is not the poem itself
	- sense that there is another person listening (silent interlocutor) & the reader

- Silent Interlocutor in Browning's poem
	- dead/someone listening in

- two levels of hearing and listening
	- one inside the poem
	- and one outside the poem

- **the dramatic monolgogue is all the more concerned with eharing things and how it difficult it is to ehar things**
	- gets us to think about what it means to read and how it matters

*the gift of ears* (Auden, Words and the Word)
- Listening well as the moral quality


# Browning
- look up biography
	- *came from an evangelical family*
	- many of his poems were published in pamphlet form 
	- *think about the collections in which the poems appear and get a sense of the poet in their original context*

- Dramatic Monologues published in *Men and Women*

"When last words are recorded and replayed.... from the person who first spoke them" - 19th Century encountering of many different inventions (telegram, recorder)

- critiques of browning
	- nt readable, totally incomprehensible, muddy and unmusical
		- brwoning is meant to be difficult, the closest poet to someone like Ts Elliot.
		- tangly, fragmented and difficult in that kind of way
	- penchant for elliptical diction,

- interest in imagining how he might be heard, a loss of authority
	- form that captures the ==printed voice==
		- concerns about increasing distance and alienation
	- an interest in past and present

- look at his poem 'Cleon' (1855)
	- * think of who did the translation in this imaginary world*
	- parallel about Cleon and Browning (fear of one day his poems will be read in the future)
		- repetition on 'still' - could mean ongoing and perpetual, but also could be paralyzed --> // the life of a text
		- brownings fear abt being heard is mixed in with his interest of all the technological advancements (seismic change in technology)
			- mass production of texts/pamphlets 

- pamphlets as in competition with the novel form
	- as a poet, conscious that poetry was becoming an extinct form, so trying to serialise it in the way that Dickens was etc.

- Robert Browning, The Ring and the Book
	- "the printed voice"
		- as a key that speaks to increasing alienation and distance

- strange, weird midns that are not one's own (solipsism) - characteristic of dramatic monologue, especially Browning's

### My Last Duchess
- allows us to explore something interesting
- shows Browning's interest in exploring minds on the edge of madness/morally unstable

- power struggle between the hand of the poet and the character
	- in the dramatic monologue, the hand of the poet is in it in a particular way
- the sturggle of framing, the one being framed and the one framing (poet)


**Intersection of Psychology and Literature**
- West minister review - intersection of psychology and literature
- \____ faas 
- gregory tate (The poet's mind)

- Browning's dramatic monologues are not entirely sympathetic
	- ==they facilitate/demonstrate a crafted experience of **failed imagining** (flat characters) - an act of reliogious and moral humility==


- Browning "Two in the Campagna" (1855)
	- For printed voice, need to look at where print really comes to surface --> can see how voice is rendered or not rendered.
		- brackets, ellipses, dashes (things that CANT be said)
	- speaker is desperate to find out how the silent interloculator feels
	- "only I discern –"
		- can be read in two ways - more humble or more self-centred

* need to allow the ambiguity of the printed voice to speak - fine line btw the workings of the voice and complete madness
### an act of religious nad moral humility
- Browning is ALWAYS talking about 

- John Ruskin "Essay on Literature" (1836)
	- Sense of Faith and Faith seems to be dwinding

- browning has no faith in Literature moving forward (*the Ring and the Book*, Book I)

- relating to the fact that HE is not god
	- "mimic creation, galvanism for life"
- "negotiating his own position against faith"
	- if youre not living through the various questions that the 19th centruy poets are grappling with, its hard to understand whats at stake
	- if DM is about getting close to the work, then Browning might have been constantly in an area of crisis and getting close to the word/work of god


- dramatic monologues are hard to hear because they are elusive, theres a lot of textual allusions
	- for Browning, its related to "higher criticism(??)"
		- 1980s, research into the christianism and the bible & trying to think of the bible as a work of truth
		- Since the making of books there is no end (see handout)
			- feeling of never finding the begininng & that there is no finish point, and further, that there is no point
			- Browning as in a state of uncertainty about Faith and faith in literature as offering help and consolation to the poeple

- Sianne Ngai, *Ugly Feelings*
	- Animatedness
		- when a human is made to seem excessively emotional in a mechanical way, often racialised and dehumanised
		- animation has been reclaimed by writers of colour as a kind of protest
		
		- we can see Browning's characters as kind of being Animated, sort of being at point 1, frames them as being puppets, ethical failure
			- interested in violence, 


- Browning poems - mostly about failed likenesses because he believed the Jesus was the only one that could be like someone else
