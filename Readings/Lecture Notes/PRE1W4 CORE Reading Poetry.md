4Ms of poetry

2. Music (rhyme meter, pacing, etc.)
3. Message (meanings, descriptive content, tone, etc.)
4. Magic (iykyk)

1. Movement
	- To Prue his maid
		- single sentence, appears to be an epitath
		- syntax: 
			- builds suspense immediately by keeping the subject of the poem at a distance (unlike other epitets)
			- "is laid" vs "here lies"
			- additional preoposition movement ("from") instead of stopping at the second line --> keeps the life going
