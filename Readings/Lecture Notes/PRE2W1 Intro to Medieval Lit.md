## Conquest and Transformation: An Introduction to Early Medieval Literature (c. 650–1350)

---

## Introduction: Reading at the Edge of Worlds  

The *Early Medieval Literature* paper spans an immense chronological and linguistic range — from the earliest Old English poetry of the seventh century to the emergence of Middle English and Anglo-Norman culture by the fourteenth. The period witnesses extraordinary transformations in language, belief, and identity. Its literature — written, carved, and sung — records how people at the periphery of Europe imagined their place in a world of shifting powers.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Edge as Origin**  
> Early English writing emerges from contact zones: between orality and literacy, pagan and Christian, native and foreign. Its peripherality is its defining feature. What we now call “English literature” begins as a literature of crossings — of seas, of tongues, of gods.

## I. The Many Languages of Early Britain  

The lecture opens by emphasising the multilingual nature of the early medieval British Isles. **Old English** coexisted with **Old Norse**, **Latin**, **Old Welsh**, **Old Irish**, and after 1066, **Norman French**:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}. This was a *linguistic archipelago*, not a single voice.  

### Oral and Written Culture  
- *Old English* texts survive mainly in four great manuscripts (Exeter, Vercelli, Junius, Beowulf MS).  
- But the culture was predominantly oral — as shown by *riddles*, *charms*, and *songs* that move fluidly between speech and script.  

The **Exeter Book Riddle** of the *bookworm* makes the point playfully: the creature “consumes words” yet learns nothing. Reading, the riddle suggests, is not consumption but *rumination*.

## II. Old English, Old Norse, and the North-Sea World  

### Contact and Exchange  

Old English and Old Norse are sister languages — both West Germanic, mutually intelligible like modern Danish and Norwegian. Their speakers mingled in trade, settlement, and war. From the Viking Age (793–1066), the British Isles formed part of a *North Sea cultural zone*, a world of shared stories and symbols.  

Old Norse, though never written down in England, profoundly shaped English vocabulary and place-names:  
- **Place-names**: *-thwaite* (“clearing”), *-by* (“farm”), *-gate* (“street”).  
- **Loanwords**: *window, law, sky, knife, skirt,* and even the pronouns *they, them, their* — a rare instance of grammatical borrowing:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.  

### The Battle of Maldon: Dialect and Identity  

The poem *The Battle of Maldon* (c. 1000) preserves a speech by a **Viking messenger** who demands tribute from the English earl Byrhtnoth:  

> “Brave seafarers have sent me to you... It’s better for you to buy off this spear-rush with tribute than to face such fierce battle.”:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

Linguistic evidence — words like *eorl* (OE *nobleman*, cf. ON *jarl*), *snelle* (OE *quick*, ON *brave*), and *grið* (ON *truce*) — suggests the messenger may be speaking English with a Scandinavian accent, making this the earliest known use of **dialect in English literature**.  

The poem’s cast also embodies cultural fusion: Anglo-Saxon *Ælfere* fights beside the Dane *Maccus*; Wulfstan’s son bears the Norse name *Vésteinn*. Ethnic identity, like language, is fluid — an interlacing of English and Norse loyalties.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Politics of Mixture**  
> The *Maldon* poet writes in a world where invader and defender are kin. His “English” heroes have Scandinavian names; his Viking’s speech sounds half-English. The poem turns war into a dialogue of shared tongues — a battle fought as much in language as in arms.

---

## III. Mapping the Periphery: *Beowulf* and the North  

No character in *Beowulf* comes from England. Its action unfolds across Denmark and southern Sweden, on the **periphery of the world** as imagined by Anglo-Saxon maps like the *Cotton Tiberius* mappa mundi:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.  

Recent critics argue that this peripherality is the poem’s true subject: “exile, mixture, loss, and survival.” The poet writes from a Christian England looking back on a pagan North — a world both ancestral and alien.  

### The Story of Sigemund and Fitela  

At *Beowulf* ll. 874–884, the court poet celebrates Beowulf’s victory by recounting the legend of **Sigemund**, whose Norse version (Sigmundr) was Odin’s son and incestuous father of **Sinfjötli**. In *Beowulf*, the poet hints at this darker myth:  

> “The strife of Wæls’s son, his wide journeys, feuds and crimes, except that Fitela was with him...”:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

The phrase *fæhðe ond fyrena* (“feuds and crimes”) echoes the same description used of the monster Grendel, blurring boundaries between hero and outlaw.  

> **Mini-Essay — Hero and Monster**  
> The poet’s allusion to Sigemund’s crimes reminds us that heroism and monstrosity share the same vocabulary. In the northern imagination, glory and guilt are twins; every act of vengeance risks turning man into monster.

---

## IV. Conquest and Cultural Transformation  

### 1066 and After  

The **Norman Conquest** brings linguistic and cultural revolution. French replaces English as the language of court and law; Latin remains the language of learning. England, once northern-looking, is pulled south into continental Europe.  

**Key turning points:**  
- 1096–99: *The First Crusade* — violence recast as sanctified; Christian warriors could now achieve salvation through battle.  
- 1215: *Magna Carta* — the idea of **just kingship under law**, a distinctively English political myth:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.  

### The Changing Image of God  

- **Old English Christianity** (*The Dream of the Rood*): Christ as warrior — “The young hero stripped himself, strong and resolute.”  
- **Later Middle English piety** (*Stond wel, moder, under rode*): Christ as suffering son — “Mother, now I will tell you: if I do not die, you go to hell; I suffer death for your sake.”:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  

This shift marks the rise of **affective piety** — devotion through shared emotion and compassion, a theology of feeling.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Tears of Power**  
> Early medieval art made God the strongest warrior; later medieval devotion made him the most wounded. Both figures answer the same question: how can divine power enter human pain? The transformation from strength to suffering is the spiritual conquest of the Middle Ages.

---

## V. The Fighting Man: Warrior, Crusader, Knight  

The heroic pagan (*Beowulf*), the penitent Christian (*The Battle of Maldon*), and the chivalric knight (*The Song of Roland*, *Havelok the Dane*) form a continuous evolution of the ideal of the **fighting man**.  

| Phase | Text / Example | Defining Idea |
|-------|----------------|---------------|
| **Pagan Warrior** | *Beowulf*: “Let him who may gain glory before death.” | Glory before death; fame as immortality. |
| **Christian Sacrifice** | *The Battle of Maldon*: Byrhtnoth prays for salvation; none is promised. | Heroism shadowed by sin; violence as moral peril. |
| **Holy War** | *The Song of Roland* (c.1100): “They carry the count’s soul to Paradise.” | Violence redeemed as service to God. |
| **Chivalric Romance** | *Chrétien de Troyes*, *Havelok the Dane* | Aristocratic ideal; honour, courtly love, lawful kingship. |

> **Mini-Essay — From War to Law**  
> The pagan hero sought fame; the Christian warrior sought forgiveness; the knight sought legitimacy. The long arc from *Beowulf* to *Havelok* charts Europe’s conversion from courage to conscience.

---

## VI. Interiority and the Self  

The late medieval period brings a new attention to the **inner life** — from public penance to private confession.  

- *Ælfric’s Lives of Saints* (c.995): “True contrition and penance... washes us again from sins.”  
- *Ancrene Wisse* (c.1225): “Confession must be accusatory, bitter with sorrow, whole, naked...”  
- *Richard Rolle, Form of Living* (1340s): Love is inward, “in the will verraily, not in work.”:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  

This movement from external act to inward intent — from fasting to feeling — marks the birth of psychological selfhood in Western literature.  

---

## VII. Fiction, Love, and the Invention of Romance  

From the twelfth century, new *fictional* forms appear, blending classical legend with French courtly ideals.  

- **Wace**, *Roman de Brut* (c.1155): “It is for love and for lovers that knights do knightly deeds.”  
- **Marie de France**, *Lanval* and *Guigemar*: Love as both desire and moral test.  
- **Havelok the Dane** (c.1290): The English romance of virtue and kingship; the warrior becomes a just ruler:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Birth of Fiction**  
> Romance transforms the warrior’s strength into narrative desire. To conquer a kingdom becomes to win a lady; to love rightly becomes to rule rightly. Fiction is born when power learns to dream.

---

## VIII. The Arc of the Period  

From *The Dream of the Rood* to *Havelok the Dane*, early English literature traces a thousand-year meditation on faith, identity, and language:  

- **From** pagan heroism → **to** Christian humility.  
- **From** exile and survival → **to** law, order, and inheritance.  
- **From** Old English verse → **to** Middle English romance.  

> **Mini-Essay — Continuity Through Change**  
> Despite conquest after conquest — Viking, Norman, French — English writing persists by absorbing its conquerors. The language that once borrowed *they, them, their* now claims the world’s words as its own.

---

## Motif Tracker  

| **Motif** | **Example(s)** | **Interpretive Use** |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Exile / Periphery** | *Beowulf*, *The Wanderer* | Marginality as moral condition. |
| **Heroism and Sin** | *Maldon*, *Beowulf* | Violence as both glory and guilt. |
| **Mixture and Exchange** | OE–ON cognates, bilingual names | Identity as hybrid; language as contact zone. |
| **Suffering Christ** | *Dream of the Rood*, *Stond wel, moder* | Shift from strength to compassion. |
| **Confession and Selfhood** | *Ancrene Wisse* | The inward turn of spirituality. |
| **Love and Kingship** | *Marie de France*, *Havelok* | Romance as political allegory. |

---

## Critical Lenses  

| **Axis** | **Relationship** | **Implication** |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Pagan ↔ Christian** | Continuity and conversion | Literature mediates moral transition. |
| **Oral ↔ Written** | Riddles, inscriptions, manuscripts | Memory and monument as twin forms. |
| **North ↔ South** | Beowulf’s Denmark → Norman France | England’s shifting cultural compass. |
| **Public ↔ Private** | Penance → Confession → Selfhood | Emergence of individual conscience. |
| **Masculine ↔ Feminine** | Warrior Christ ↔ Weeping Mary | Compassion redefines strength. |

---

## Exam Relevance  

**For Prelims Paper 2 (Early Medieval Literature, c.650–1350):**
- Builds core awareness of **linguistic diversity** (Old English, Old Norse, Anglo-Norman, Middle English).  
- Develops skills in **close reading** of translation and form.  
- Encourages historical synthesis — connecting *Beowulf* to *Havelok*, *The Dream of the Rood* to *Marie de France*.  

### Model Essay Patterns  
1. **“Mixture, Loss, and Survival: Beowulf and the Idea of the Periphery.”**  
2. **“From Warrior to Saint: The Transformation of Heroism in Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Norman Literature.”**  
3. **“The Birth of the Inner Life: Penance and Confession in Medieval English Texts.”**

	- Old Norse was a high status, language spoken by the king and aristocracy

Impact
- Place names, especially with Old Norse heritage
- Old Norse loan words in Old English (esp. in 11th century onwards, early middle english texts) --> They Them Their pronouns are borrowed from Old Norse


Battle of Molden Set Tect - Speech made by viking messenger to leader (II. 79-80, 185-187)
- Argued that the messenger is speaking old english with scandivanian accent dialect
	- OE eorl - earl; ON jarl - high social standing

- Sigemund = ON Sigmundr (descendant of Odin,)
- Fitela = ON sinfjötli (Sigmundr + sister's son)

- eam his nefan: uncle to his nephoew --> does the OE poet know that ... is his son?


## Conquest & Transformation
1. 1066: Norman Conquest& 1154: A new culture at court

	- statement of the right
	- Lex stat, rex cadit
	- mythical culture that King John has been a tyrant and rightfully
	- ** self-conscious citizenry - just kingship under the law, super different from prev year


## Cultural
1. Perception of God (strongest --> the suffering/bleeding christ on the cross) & Man --> affective piety (based on feeling, affection, to *feel* with christ's suffering; the idea that suffering is noble)
	- God as the strongest figure (new religion trying to meld itself onto the warrior religion its trying to overcome)
	- CHrist as the suffering and dying figure: when Christ is on the cross and weeping
2. The figting man: pagan warrior (achilles, beowulf) --> christian sacrifice (commit violence without going to hell) --> chilvaric life
	- Pagan warrior (glory before death) - 
		- The 'Great buckle' from Sutton Hoo
			- Beowulf is written by a Christian poem
	- Christian Sacrifice
		- The battle of Maldon - the figure of Britnof praying to god that he should be saved

	- Crusade
		- The Song of ROland (Oxford ROland)
			- Christian warrior fighting for the king BUT after he dies, he gets to go to heaven - THey carry the count's soul to paradise (thats what the crusade promised and how they commanded army)

			- "It was a king bi are-dawes"


3. Interiority & Selfhood
	- worry that everything that you do will send you to hell,
	-
