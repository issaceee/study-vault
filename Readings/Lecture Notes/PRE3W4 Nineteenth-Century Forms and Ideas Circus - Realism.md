**# Realism: (Nearly Real)  
### Sophie Ratcliffe — Oxford Prelims Paper 3 (1830–1910)

---

## Introduction: What Is Real?  

Sophie Ratcliffe opens by posing the question that realism can never quite settle: **what is real, and to whom?** (Ratcliffe 2025). “Realism,” “real,” and “realistic” are distinct — and keeping them distinct, Ratcliffe insists, is an *ethical duty*.  

- *The real* — a **philosophical** and **political** question. It concerns perception, materiality, and power: “whose world counts as real?”  
- *The realistic* — a **judgement** about plausibility. “That’s not realistic” means “that doesn’t fit my sense of what’s possible.”  
- *Realism* — a **literary mode or method**, often mistaken for transparency, but fundamentally a *representation of representation*.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Real, the Realistic, and Realism**  
> The term “realism” has always been unstable because it claims both to describe the world and to interpret it. What counts as “real” shifts with power: whose story, whose language, whose image stands for the truth?  

Ratcliffe begins with an anecdote from *The Amateur Photographer* (24 July 1885):contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}:  

> “She had never been satisfied with the portraits which professional photographers made for her... She has thus far made one hundred and sixty-seven different pictures of herself.”  

This early “selfie” captures realism’s core dilemma: **the conflict between representation and reality**, between the desire to see oneself truly and the limits of technology and self-perception. The image is never identical to the self; yet the attempt to reproduce truth generates endless versions.  

The story also appears in a journal that itself fretted about authenticity: “letters must be authenticated by the name and address of the sender.” Reality, already in 1885, was a matter of verification and performance — a precursor to *fake news*.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Self in Representation**  
> The girl’s 167 self-portraits parody the realist project: a pursuit of truth through repetition, a faith that one more exposure might finally reveal the real. But her camera captures not essence but process — the infinite deferral of self-knowledge.

## I. Defining Realism: Truth, Representation, and Power  

### Truthful Treatment of Material  

William Dean **Howells**, in *Criticism and Fiction* (1891), defined realism as “**nothing more and nothing less than the truthful treatment of material**”:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. But this immediately prompts questions: *which* material? *whose* truth? *what counts* as truthful treatment?  

**Theodore Dreiser** adds that “true art speaks plainly: the seeing of what is.” Realism, in this light, aspires to *plain style* — language as a clear pane of glass. Yet, as Ratcliffe notes, George Orwell’s famous image of prose as a “windowpane” already complicates itself: metaphor renders transparency opaque.  

### Realism as Reflexivity  

Critics such as **Nigel Wheale** argue that realism’s apparent transparency is its greatest illusion:  

> “Insofar as realism pretends to offer an unproblematic representation, it is in fact the most deceptive form of representation, reproducing its assumptions through the audience’s unexamined response to an apparently natural image or text.” (Wheale 1995)  

Realism, far from naïve, is deeply self-conscious — “radically reflexive,” as Ratcliffe puts it. Even canonical realist novels continually draw attention to their own artifice.  

**George Eliot’s** *Adam Bede* begins not with natural description but with a conjuring trick:  

> “With a single drop of ink for a mirror, the Egyptian sorcerer undertakes to reveal... visions of the past. This is what I undertake to do for you, reader.” (Eliot 1859, ch. 1)  

The “drop of ink” is not transparency but *alchemy*: realism is spell, not mirror.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Mirror and the Spell**  
> Eliot’s opening confounds the myth of transparency. Realism claims to show the world “as it is,” yet it does so by invoking sorcery, metaphor, and manipulation. Its truth lies in **ethical intent**, not optical accuracy.  

### The Democratic Ideal  

For **Rachel Bowlby**, nineteenth-century realism participated in the “**democratising movements** of the nineteenth century, bringing into view common worlds of experience previously unseen or out of bounds” (Bowlby 2007).  

Realism’s moral project was inclusivity: to represent the lives of those excluded from polite fiction — the poor, the working class, women, the colonised. But this inclusivity masked paradox: the *real* was still defined by the gaze of the middle-class author.  

**George Eliot**, reviewing Ruskin’s *Modern Painters III* (1856), described realism as “a humble and faithful study of nature,” the pursuit of beauty through “definite, substantial reality.” Yet her “faithful study” depends on an implicit hierarchy between observer and observed.  

> **Mini-Essay — Whose Realism?**  
> To claim democratic representation is itself an act of power. Whose world is “made visible” in realist fiction? To write *about* the poor or enslaved may still privilege the author’s perspective as the lens of truth.

## II. Expanding the Canon: Hannah Crafts and the Gothic Real  

Ratcliffe turns to **Hannah Crafts’s *The Bondswoman’s Narrative*** (c.1850s, pub. 2002) as a counterexample to white, Anglophone definitions of realism:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}. Likely the first novel by an African-American woman, it complicates every critical category.  

### Reading and Power  

Crafts’s heroine, Hannah, hides behind damask curtains “with a book” — a scene that echoes *Jane Eyre* and *Bleak House*. She reads secretly, using literacy to claim selfhood. This small act of reading is itself *realist resistance* — asserting that “reading novels” is a thing that really happens, a form of lived experience.  

### Realism and the Gothic  

In one scene, an illiterate field slave, Joe, reports seeing a ghost. The narrative shifts from realism to Gothic:  

> “Oh, Missus, de ghost, de ghost, sabe me from de ghost.”  

Ratcliffe reads this as a deliberate collapse of genre boundaries. What looks like “unreal” Gothic fantasy becomes the most *realistic* depiction of enslaved fear imaginable.  

**Hilary Mantel**, reviewing the novel, argued that “**the Gothic is an apt form in which to express the feelings of the powerless**... because they are the victims of caprice, and rationality cannot save them.” (Mantel 2002)  

> **Mini-Essay — Gothic Realism**  
> For those denied agency, Gothic exaggeration can become realism. What seems “melodramatic” to a privileged reader may simply reflect the extremity of another’s truth. The Gothic thus becomes realism’s unacknowledged twin — the mode that tells emotional and political realities invisible to the “sane” world.  

### Whose Reality?  

Crafts’s novel exposes realism’s blind spot: its presumption that “the real” belongs to the secular, rational, and European. If “realism” depends on whose experience is central, then *The Bondswoman’s Narrative* redefines the real as the struggle for safety, literacy, and survival.  

> **Mini-Essay — Realism as Liberation**  
> Realism’s power lies not in reproducing surfaces but in representing *lived pain*. For Crafts, to write fiction at all is to declare one’s existence — an act of realism more radical than mimetic verisimilitude.

---

## III. Realism and Its Rival: Photography  

By the mid-nineteenth century, **photography** emerged as realism’s technological competitor. Could language ever rival the camera’s claim to truth?  

The same 1885 *Amateur Photographer* anecdote reappears as emblem of anxiety: mechanical reproduction promises “truth,” yet reveals subjectivity — the self staging itself for the lens.  

**Thomas Hardy’s** *A Laodicean* (1881) captures this tension. Its heroine, Paula Power, performs acrobatics while her suitor watches “a sort of optical poem”:  

> “He had never seen beauty of such a real and living sort as this.” (Hardy 1881, Book 2, ch. 7)  

But Hardy simultaneously ironises the claim: the novel’s villain is a **photographer** who forges a drunken photograph to incriminate a rival.  

> **Mini-Essay — The False Image**  
> Hardy’s forged photograph symbolises the crisis of realism. The camera may seem impartial, but its “truth” can be edited, staged, or blurred. Photography exposes what realism hides — that every representation is an act of framing.  

### Photography as “Tradesman’s Art”  

Critics like **George Bernard Shaw** oscillated between reverence and scepticism. Shaw defended photography against claims of “mechanicalness,” arguing that even repeated exposures vary “more subtly than Velázquez’s Philips” (Shaw 1902). Yet he condemned retouched portraits — “fashionable cooking and stippling of sitters’ faces until the texture of the skin is nothing but white kid gloves” (Shaw 1887).  

The “hidden mothers” of early infant photographs — women veiled beneath drapery to hold their babies still — expose the labour behind apparent transparency. **Photography**, like realism, depends on the invisible work of framing, stabilising, and concealing.  

> **Mini-Essay — Exposure and Concealment**  
> Both novel and photograph depend on invisible mediation. Every realist frame hides its scaffolding: gendered labour, technical artifice, and social construction. The “hidden mother” becomes realism’s emblem — presence masked as absence.  

### Hardy’s Aesthetic Defence  

In *The Life of Thomas Hardy* (1910), Florence Emily Hardy (largely ghost-written by Hardy himself) records his rejection of photographic mimesis:  

> “Art is a disproportioning — a distorting — of realities, to show more clearly the features that matter... Hence ‘realism’ is not art.” (Hardy 1910)  

Hardy thus transforms realism from transparency into **selection**: art reveals truth by *departing* from mere fact.  

> **Mini-Essay — Disproportion and Truth**  
> Realism’s accuracy lies in distortion. By choosing what to emphasise, Hardy argues, the novelist makes reality legible. The mirror of realism, once thought smooth, is now deliberately warped to catch light more truthfully.

---

## IV. Realism, Class, and Representation  

**Zola** famously claimed that the novelist should “trace out the thread which leads mathematically from one man to another” — a scientific naturalism (Zola 1871). But Ratcliffe highlights the contradiction: the “raw material” of society was already writing and representing itself.  

The **working classes** were no longer merely objects of depiction but new producers of text and image — through cheap novels, periodicals, and photography. The so-called “democratisation” of realism thus reimposed a boundary between **representors** and **represented**.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Anxiety of Authorship**  
> As literacy expanded, the realist author’s authority shrank. The anxiety that photography or mass print might capture reality more directly haunted novelists. Realism became self-protective: an art of asserting mediation rather than denying it.

**George Moore’s** *Esther Waters* (1894) illustrates this paradox. Its illiterate heroine is described with aesthetic violence:  

> “Her face was a blunt outline, and the grey eyes reflected all the natural prose of the Saxon.” (Moore 1894)  

Her illiteracy becomes fetishised — a symbol of purity untouched by artifice. The “raw” working-class woman is rendered through the stylised prose of a middle-class man.  

**George Eliot** once wrote that “these fellow-mortals must be accepted as they are,” but Moore’s “natural prose” exposes the artifice of that acceptance.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Raw and the Cooked**  
> Realism’s “humble study of nature” often masks voyeurism. The “raw” becomes a rhetorical device — the illusion of access to an unmediated world produced through the most mediated of means.

---

## V. Dickens and the Real of the Unreal  

Ratcliffe ends with **Charles Dickens**, the novelist who “complicates what we mean by realism.” In *The Bloomsbury Christening* (1834), everyday London life becomes saturated with metaphor:  

> “Cabs whisked about... like any mysterious picture in one of Mrs. Radcliffe’s castles; omnibus horses smoked like steam-engines... like amateur skaters behind wooden chairs on the Serpentine.”  

Dickens’s realism is **metaphoric excess**, not restraint. His urban description spirals into self-reference: reality is seen through artifice.  

A “coquette with a large bustle... looked like a French lithograph.” The line conflates **appearance** (she *looked like*) and **perception** (*she saw herself as* a lithograph). “Look” becomes a verb of both **seeming** and **seeing** — exposing the instability of vision itself.  

In George Cruikshank’s illustration to the story, the family’s misaligned eyes repeat across generations — father, baby, and portrait. The very act of looking is askew.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Skewed Gaze**  
> Dickens’s world is visually unstable: every eye turns slightly off-centre, every perspective misaligns. Realism here is not accuracy but empathy — the recognition that we will never quite see as others do.  

### The Gothic Real  

Ratcliffe closes by returning to Hilary **Mantel’s** observation that Gothic and realism are not opposites. “There is always some spot on the map where the Gothic is literally true” (Mantel 2002).  

**Margaret Atwood**, introducing *The Handmaid’s Tale*, made a similar claim: every event “has really happened somewhere.” The Gothic’s “unbelievable” horrors thus become a form of **hyper-realism** — emotional truth intensified.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Real as Unbelievable**  
> Realism’s final paradox is that the truest realities are often those least believable. For the powerless, Gothic terror may be the most accurate language available. Realism, Ratcliffe suggests, must expand to include the unthinkable.  

---

## Conclusion: Realism’s Refracted Mirror  

Realism was never a single method but a spectrum of tensions — between truth and artifice, democracy and hierarchy, seeing and believing. Its evolution, from Howells’s “truthful treatment” to Hardy’s “disproportioning,” from Hannah Crafts’s Gothic realism to Dickens’s comic distortions, reveals not the stability but the multiplicity of “the real.”  

> **Mini-Essay — Realism as Relation**  
> To write realism is to negotiate distance: between author and subject, image and truth, viewer and viewed. The realist novel’s enduring lesson is not that art mirrors life, but that life itself is a network of representations — the “nearly real.”**

# Motif Tracker  

| **Motif** | **Example(s)** | **Interpretive Use** |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **The Real / Realistic / Realism** | Ratcliffe’s threefold distinction | Clarifies ethical and epistemological stakes: “real” as ontology, “realistic” as judgement, “realism” as form. |
| **Representation and Authenticity** | *The Amateur Photographer* (1885) | Captures the paradox of reproduction and self-perception; every “true” image is mediated. |
| **Democracy and Visibility** | Bowlby (2007); Eliot, *Adam Bede* | Realism as ethical representation of the marginalised; tension between empathy and appropriation. |
| **Gothic Realism** | *The Bondswoman’s Narrative*; Mantel (2002) | Horror and exaggeration as forms of emotional truth; realism for the powerless. |
| **Photography / Technology** | Hardy, *A Laodicean*; Shaw, *On Photography* | The camera as realism’s rival; truth versus manipulation; the aesthetics of framing. |
| **Labour and the “Tradesman’s Art”** | Victorian photography and realism | Distinction between art and craft mirrors class anxiety within realist authorship. |
| **Vision and Misalignment** | Dickens, “The Bloomsbury Christening” | The instability of sight symbolises the impossibility of unmediated understanding. |
| **Empathy and Distance** | Eliot, Mantel, Atwood | Realism’s moral dimension; to imagine the lives of others despite gaps in experience. |
| **The Real as Unbelievable** | Mantel on Gothic truth; Atwood on historical horror | The overlap of realism and fantasy in representing trauma and oppression. |

## Critical Lenses  

| **Axis** | **Relationship** | **Implication** |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Transparency ↔ Mediation** | From mirror to frame | Realism depends on acknowledging its artifice; “clear prose” always refracted. |
| **Ethics ↔ Aesthetics** | Eliot’s “faithful study of nature” | Artistic truth aligned with moral vision, yet dependent on hierarchy of gaze. |
| **Author ↔ Subject** | Zola’s “scientific” detachment vs. Crafts’s resistance | Representation as power relation; realism as both documentation and domination. |
| **Image ↔ Text** | Photography and literature | The novel learns from and competes with visual technology; seeing as reading. |
| **Realism ↔ Gothic** | Mantel’s “spot on the map where it is literally true” | Gothic exaggeration reframed as emotional realism. |
| **Realism ↔ Modernity** | Hardy’s distortion, Dickens’s metaphor | Realism anticipates modernist self-reflexivity; truth through estrangement. |
| **Seeing ↔ Believing** | “Looked like” in Dickens | Appearance and perception entangled; vision as epistemological limit. |
| **Democracy ↔ Authority** | Realism’s liberal promise | Representation extended to new classes, yet filtered through elite authorship. |

## Exam Relevance  

### Key Relevance to Paper 3 (1830–1910)

- Positions **realism** as a central yet unstable aesthetic category.  
- Encourages interrogation of **representation, class, gender, and race** within the realist project.  
- Links **Victorian visual culture** (photography, illustration) to literary technique.  
- Highlights realism’s **ethical paradox**: to empathise without appropriating.  

### Analytical Skills  

- Distinguishing between **realism as style** and **reality as concept**.  
- Identifying **self-reflexive moments** where novels question their own representational limits.  
- Reading **non-canonical realisms** (Crafts, Farro, Wells Brown) alongside Eliot, Dickens, and Hardy.  
- Comparing **visual and verbal realism** — novelistic description as proto-cinematic or photographic.  

### Model Essay Patterns  

1. **“Realism is a way of framing, not seeing.”** — Discuss through Hardy and Dickens.  
2. **“The Gothic is realism for the powerless.”** — Explore Mantel’s claim using *The Bondswoman’s Narrative*.  
3. **“Photography killed realism — or saved it.”** — Compare Hardy’s *A Laodicean* with Shaw’s photographic criticism.  
4. **“Realism is an ethical act, not a mirror.”** — Examine Eliot’s *Adam Bede* alongside Hannah Crafts and Zola.  

### Revision Strategies  

- Note Ratcliffe’s distinction: *real* / *realistic* / *realism*.  
- Read primary passages that foreground mediation — prefatory statements, descriptions of art, or scenes of reading.  
- Pair theoretical criticism (Wheale, Bowlby, Byerly) with visual history (Nancy Armstrong, Kate Flint).  
- Reflect on how realism intersects with **race, class, and technology**, extending beyond the English canon.

# Own Notes
- what is real? 
- realism vs real vs realistic -- all distinct terms that are to be kept distinct in writing

- how we represent what is seen to be real is embedded in pop culture
	- THe amateur photographer, july 24 1885: "SHe had never been satisfied with the portraits which professional..... one hunfred and sixty-seven different pictures of herself"
		- suggestion that the representation doesnt capture what she envisions herself to be
		- conflict btw limits of representation and ideal representation of her true self


what is realism?
- Howells, Criticism and Fiction: "nothing more and nothing less than the truthful treatment of material"
	- but what material, which material, what is truthful?
- Dreiser, 'True Art Speaks Plainly: "Seeing of what is...'

- a kind of writing that has a style congruent with its ambition to transparenly present the world
	- but which bits of the world?

- Nigeal Wheale, *THe Postmodern Arts: An Introductory Reader*
	- assumes the "audiences unexamined response to an apparently natural image or text"
		- underestimates how radically reflexisive most realism is - the 19th century realism novels always conscious of the fact that they cant reflect everything
			- George Eliot, Adam Bede (1859), Chap 1: "This is what I udertake to do for you..."



- Rachel Bowlby

- Becca, Documents of Modern Literary Realism - 
- Alison Byrely, Are we Nearly There Yet - "an imaginative experience that is not fully realized, but aspirational"

Other realist novels
- Sarah E Farro
- William Wells Brown

- Hannah Crafts, The Bondswoman Narrative
	- "Gloom everywhere. Gloom up the Potomac...." // Bleak House
	- 

- if realism is abt stuff that really happens, then reading novels is someting that really happened, representations of reality gets tied up with representaions of art --> life models art

- Madame Bovary?


** When we try to define a realism novel, it really depends on whose reality we see as primary
- some peoples reality might be more melodramatic or more horrific than we thought possible

Photography as Realism's rival
- could what realist writers offer the same thing or better?
- Thomas Hardy, A Laodicean: "He had never seen a beauty of such a real and living sort of this"
	- villian of the novel is a photographer; someone is setup in the novel as a forged photograph

- "art is a disproportioning [....] of realities"

- photography as being a tradesman's art, not like a poet
	- political imperative of realism, democratising and liberalising, the real only exists when upper/middle write about lower?
	- there seems to be a boundary between representors and what they are representing

- "look" - appeared to be - we will never know how anyone else looks, appears and looks at the world
