## Metre IV: Blank Verse, Syntax, and Sound  
### Ushashi Dasgupta — Oxford Prelims Paper 1 & 3 (2025)

---

## Introduction: The Line as Measure and as Mark  

Dasgupta begins the final lecture by calling metre “a **nutritious topic** — like a green smoothie.” It may seem unappetising, but it sustains everything else (Dasgupta 2025).  
Earlier sessions explored metre as *rhythm and constraint*. This lecture turns from sound to **syntax and the page**, asking how poets use the **line** — not only as aural rhythm but as visual and syntactic punctuation:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  

In prose, the compositor decides how long the line is. In verse, the poet does.  
That choice — how to break, pause, or continue — becomes the grammar of thought.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Two Histories of the Line**  
> The “line” combines the sonic and the visual. The Greek *metron* (“measure”) implied pure rhythm, with no visual connotation. But the Latin *versus* (“turn”) described a physical act — the poet’s hand turning back at the margin like a plough. Poetry, therefore, always contains both sound and inscription: a rhythm made visible.

Dasgupta stresses the historical shift: the English word *line* first referred to verse only **after the invention of print**, when Gutenberg’s letterpress made the line a typographical unit.  
The compositor set each line of type separately, using **leads** — thin strips of metal — to separate the lines. Even the space between verses was *manufactured*.

## I. The Line as Punctuation  

### From Syntax to Segmentation  

Whereas the previous lecture treated the line as a **unit of rhythm**, here it becomes a **unit of grammar** — “a secondary punctuation system laid over the first” (Dasgupta 2025).  
Every poem negotiates between **syntactic segmentation** (phrases, clauses, sentences) and **metrical segmentation** (line, caesura, stanza).  

**Giorgio Agamben**, glossing Valéry’s claim that poetry is a “hesitation between sound and sense,” argued that this friction — between sentence and line — is the only sure criterion separating poetry from prose.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Friction of Forms**  
> The poetic line arises from tension between natural and artificial pause. It creates two intersecting systems — syntax (sense) and metre (sound). Meaning occurs not where they coincide, but where they **diverge**.  

Dasgupta shows that poetic feeling depends on this divergence:  
- A thought that runs **past** its metrical limit creates overflow (enjambment).  
- A thought that ends **too soon** creates shock (caesural truncation).  

Neither effect exists in prose.

## II. William Carlos Williams and the Modern Line  

Dasgupta turns to **William Carlos Williams’s “To a Poor Old Woman”** (1934) as a study in lineation.  
The poem depicts a woman eating plums on the street, recorded in minimal free verse:  

> “They taste good to her.”  

Williams repeats and re-breaks this phrase several times:  

1. *They taste good to her.*  
2. *They taste / good to her.*  
3. *They taste good / to her.*  

Each variation shifts stress and empathy.  
The first reads as an observation — objective truth.  
The second isolates “good,” affirming taste as pleasure.  
The third, pausing before “to her,” foregrounds subjectivity — goodness as personal.  

> **Mini-Essay — Syntax as Ethics**  
> Williams’s line breaks enact attention. By isolating “to her,” he centres the woman’s perception.  
> “They taste good” is a general truth; “good to her” becomes a moral one.  
> Metre and syntax thus become **acts of care** — poetic structure reconfigures perception.

Dasgupta plays archival recordings (1942, 1955) of Williams reading the poem.  
In both, the poet stresses “good” but hesitates before “to her.”  
These pauses, Dasgupta observes, are **prosodic empathy** — rhythm as social attention.  

Williams’s experiment shows that line breaks are not merely formal: they register a poet’s ethics of looking and listening.

## III. Syntax and Sound: Milton, Inversion, and the Weight of Order  

### Inversion and Blank Verse  

The lecture then returns to **Milton’s *Paradise Lost***, specifically the line:  

> “But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad.”  

Grammatically inverted, it would read in prose as “But look, the morn clad in russet mantle.”  
Why invert? Because poetic English prioritises **phonological rhythm over syntactic order**.  

**Gilbert Youmans**, in his work on inversion, claims poets only invert when metre demands it.  
Dasgupta disagrees: “Poets choose inversion not out of necessity but desire — to sound heightened, distant, or strange.”:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

> **Mini-Essay — The Poetic Right to Disorder**  
> In English prose, syntax outranks sound. In verse, this hierarchy reverses: phonology rules meaning.  
> Poets use inversion not as error but as elevation, making the ordinary dramatic.

Dasgupta compares Milton’s inversions to those in prose translations from the same period — notably Nicholas Caussin’s *Treatise on the Motives to Christian Perfection* (1653):  

> “If we be unknown to God, we must make ourselves known to Him by some good virtue.”  

Here syntax remains modern; the grammar is ordinary.  
Milton’s inversions therefore signal poetry’s distinctive logic — **sound outranking syntax**.

## IV. The Fourfold Matrix of Line and Sense  

Dasgupta offers a **two-by-two model** for understanding how syntax and metre align or diverge:  

| | **Syntax coincides with line** | **Syntax diverges from line** |
|---|---|---|
| **Short phrases** | *Go and catch a falling star* — sense and line match neatly; simplicity and closure. | *In Memoriam IX*: “Fair ship that from the Italian shore / Sails on the placid ocean-plains” — enjambment as gentle drift. |
| **Long sentences** | Pope’s *Essay on Man*: “Say first, of God above, or man below, / What can we reason but from what we know?” — balance and symmetry. | Milton’s *Paradise Lost*: long periodic syntax running over line-ends — grandeur and tension. |

Each quadrant yields a different affect:  
- Top left: composure.  
- Top right: restlessness.  
- Bottom left: reason.  
- Bottom right: sublimity.  

> **Mini-Essay — Architecture of Meaning**  
> Every poem chooses its position on this grid.  
> Alignment breeds harmony; disjunction breeds energy.  
> Poetic thinking arises from these rhythmic misfits — sense suspended between beats.

## V. Wordsworth and the “Blessing in This Breeze”  

Dasgupta next reads **Wordsworth’s opening to *The Prelude* (1850 version)**:  

> “There is a blessing in this gentle breeze,  
> That blows from the green fields and from the sky...”  

He calls this one of the strangest English openings: delayed subject, overqualified clauses, and withheld agency.  
The line begins with the dummy “There is,” postponing revelation.  
The syntax accumulates prepositional phrases (“from the green fields and from the sky”) before yielding to emotion.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Poise of Beginning**  
> Wordsworth’s delay is philosophical: thought outpaces grammar.  
> The poet begins with uncertainty — a sentence “askew, like an old-fashioned scale before the weights are applied.”  
> This postponement enacts Romantic hesitation — the belief that truth arises through process, not statement.

Dasgupta dissects the sound patterning: the repeated *b* in “blessing” and “breeze,” the long vowels, the sibilant endings (*-ing*, *-ze*).  
This alliteration and assonance create “patterns of call and response” — the poem listening to itself.  

He compares this to the later echo:  

> “The earth is all before me.”  

This line, Dasgupta notes, “alludes metrically as well as lexically” to Milton’s *Paradise Lost*:  

> “The world was all before them, where to choose / Their place of rest.”  

The borrowing is not just verbal but metrical: a **seven-syllable run** followed by caesura. Wordsworth’s blank verse inherits Milton’s music even as it reinterprets exile as freedom.

## VI. Keats’s *Hyperion*: Blank Verse That Falters  

Dasgupta contrasts **Keats’s *Hyperion*** with *The Prelude* to show what happens when blank verse falters.  

Opening lines:  

> “Deep in the shady sadness of a vale  
> Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn...”  

Keats’s adjectives (“shady,” “sadness,” “healthy,” “breath”) multiply endlessly.  
Dasgupta argues the poem “thinks in tetrameter but stretches to pentameter,” padding its lines with weak modifiers:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.  

In manuscript, Keats revised *“Forest on forest hung about his head / Like cloud on cloud.”*  
Originally he wrote “whose head,” then crossed it out — discovering that a sentence can **end mid-line**.  
This hesitation marks his unease with blank verse: “a rhyming poet learning to do without rhyme.”  

> **Mini-Essay — When Blank Verse Breaks**  
> Blank verse demands syntactic adventure to replace rhyme’s closure.  
> Keats’s repetition of adjectives (“shady sadness”) reveals the anxiety of that loss — filling sonic gaps with descriptive excess.  

---

## VII. Learning to Hear: Memory and Influence  

The lecture closes with a meditation on **learning metre**.  
Dasgupta warns students that “verse is a language best learned young — like a mother tongue.”  
He quotes Wordsworth’s letter to a younger poet:  

> “If you have not practised metre in youth, I should apprehend that your thoughts would not easily accommodate themselves to those chains.” (Wordsworth, *Letter to Catherine Godwin*, 1829)  

> **Mini-Essay — The Discipline of Habit**  
> Metre, like grammar, becomes second nature through repetition.  
> The poet who internalises rhythm early can later “move under it with grace and spirit.”  
> The untrained adult, by contrast, “writes iambics as a foreigner speaks French — fluently but without idiom.”  

Dasgupta concludes with Gerard Manley **Hopkins**, who claimed of *The Wreck of the Deutschland*:  

> “I had long had haunting my ear the echo of a new rhythm which I now realised on paper.”  

For Hopkins, novelty was **haunting memory** — a new rhythm emerging from echoes of the old.  

> **Mini-Essay — Metre as Memory**  
> Even the most radical poets build from what they’ve memorised.  
> Reading and recitation are the apprenticeship of rhythm.  
> The mind’s ear, not the page, is where poetry lives.

## Motif Tracker  

| **Motif** | **Example(s)** | **Interpretive Use** |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Line as Measure / Line as Mark** | From Gutenberg’s press to Milton’s inversions | The line becomes both auditory and visual — rhythm materialised in print. |
| **Syntax vs. Sound** | Agamben on hesitation; Wordsworth’s “Blessing in this Breeze” | Poetry defined by friction between sentence and line; meaning born in delay. |
| **Ethics of Attention** | Williams’s “To a Poor Old Woman” | Line breaks as moral gestures; rhythm performing empathy and care. |
| **Inversion and Order** | Milton’s *Paradise Lost* | Elevation through disobedience; syntax subordinated to music. |
| **Freedom and Structure** | Free verse vs. iambic legacy | Rebellion depends on inherited rhythm; modern liberty haunted by measure. |
| **Memory and Influence** | Hopkins’s “echo of a new rhythm” | Innovation as return; new rhythms born from remembered patterns. |
| **Falling and Rising** | Trochaic and dactylic echoes; Keats’s faltering blank verse | Motion of descent as emotional vulnerability; rising rhythm as renewal. |
| **Blank Verse and Philosophy** | Wordsworth and Milton | The unrhymed line as moral form: reason sustained by sound rather than closure. |

---

## Critical Lenses  

| **Axis** | **Relationship** | **Implication** |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Sound ↔ Syntax** | Collision between auditory rhythm and grammatical logic | Poetic thought arises from the meeting point of noise and meaning. |
| **Visual ↔ Auditory** | The page’s shape vs. the ear’s pattern | Modern verse foregrounds the *visible* line as artistic choice; metre as typography. |
| **Freedom ↔ Tradition** | Free verse indebted to iambic regularity | No poetic freedom without an inherited order to react against. |
| **Empathy ↔ Technique** | Williams’s measured care | Formal decisions carry ethical consequence: rhythm embodies attention. |
| **Memory ↔ Innovation** | Hopkins’s new rhythm from old echo | Creativity as recursive hearing; progress built on recollection. |
| **Authority ↔ Experiment** | Milton’s inversions, Keats’s revisions | Control and error both generate discovery; imperfection as invention. |
| **Philosophy ↔ Form** | Wordsworth’s delayed syntax | Grammar as metaphysics; hesitation as mode of thought. |
| **Discipline ↔ Delight** | “Nutritious” study of metre | Poetic training as both moral labour and pleasure of mastery. |

## Exam Relevance  

### Core Relevance to Prelims Papers 1 and 3  

- Reinforces **technical precision in scansion and syntax** — essential for close reading.  
- Bridges **metrical history from Milton to Modernism**, showing evolution of the English line.  
- Offers conceptual tools for essays on **form, freedom, and attention**.  
- Equips students to read both **metrical and free verse** through the same lens of ethics and sound.  

### Analytical Skills  

- Scanning and analysing **blank verse** with reference to syntax and enjambment.  
- Interpreting **lineation as argument** — when and why poets break or sustain syntax.  
- Comparing **metre and moral thought**: poetic rhythm as ethical stance.  
- Connecting **print history** (typography, punctuation) with literary form.  

### Model Essay Patterns  

1. **“The line is the poet’s conscience.”** — Discuss how syntax and metre shape moral awareness in Wordsworth and Milton.  
2. **“Blank verse is both freedom and chain.”** — Examine the paradox in Keats and Wordsworth.  
3. **“To break a line is to make a thought.”** — Compare Williams’s modernism to earlier English blank verse.  
4. **“Innovation begins in memory.”** — Explore Hopkins’s and Auden’s rhythms as echoes of older music.  

### Revision Strategies  

- Practise scanning Miltonic blank verse aloud: identify **caesura**, **enjambment**, and **inversion**.  
- Rewrite a short prose passage into verse lines to understand syntactic breakage.  
- Revisit Wordsworth’s *Prelude* and Keats’s *Hyperion* to contrast **metrical confidence and anxiety**.  
- Listen to archival recordings (Williams, Eliot, Auden) to hear how **spoken rhythm diverges from the printed line**.
