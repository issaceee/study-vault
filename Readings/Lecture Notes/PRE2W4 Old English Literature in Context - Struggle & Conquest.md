## Introduction: From Reform to Ruin  

This lecture concludes the *Old English in Context* series by tracing English literary production from the **Benedictine Reform** of the tenth century through to the **Norman Conquest** and its aftermath (Burns 2025). It explores how a culture of monastic learning and royal stability gave way to political collapse, ethnic violence, and linguistic transformation.  

The period between **959** and **1100** witnessed dramatic change:  
- The consolidation of the **West Saxon kingship** under Edgar and Æthelred.  
- The **renewed Viking incursions** and shifting loyalties within England.  
- The **Saint Brice’s Day Massacre** (1002) and Danish retaliation.  
- The **Battle of Maldon** (991) and the literature of loyalty and failure.  
- The rise of **Danish and Norman rulers**, culminating in 1066.  
- The survival of **Old English poetics** into an Anglo-Norman world.  

> **Mini-Essay — History as Continuity and Copying**  
> Burns begins by reminding students that Old English texts are often preserved in **eleventh-century copies** of much earlier works. “Why copy Beowulf in the 10th or 11th century?” she asks. Each act of copying reveals not nostalgia but *continuing meaning*: how later monastic scribes repurposed heroic poetry to understand their own turbulent age.

## I. Reform, Learning, and the Monastic Revival  

### Ælfric of Eynsham: Teacher and Theologian  

A central figure of the **Benedictine Reform** is **Ælfric** (c.955–1010), a monk and prolific writer of homilies, saints’ lives, and grammatical treatises. Educated by **Bishop Æthelwold** of Winchester, Ælfric saw writing as pedagogy — a way to instruct clergy and laity alike in moral and linguistic understanding.  

His *Grammar* (the first written in English) and *Homilies* exemplify the reform’s twin goals:  
- To standardise monastic education.  
- To interpret scripture through vernacular accessibility.  

Ælfric’s *Life of St Eugenia* offers a striking case study. Eugenia, a Christian woman fleeing persecution, **cross-dresses** as a monk to enter a male monastery. When accused of assault, she reveals her breast before the judge — her father — to prove her innocence.  

> **Mini-Essay — Gender and Transformation**  
> The tale of Eugenia fuses the miraculous with the psychological. Ælfric presents her cross-dressing as both **spiritual disguise** and **transcendence of gender**. Burns links this to patristic theology: St Jerome’s claim that “a woman who wishes to serve Christ must cease to be womanly.” The story thus becomes an early meditation on gendered sanctity and the mutable body.

## II. Kingship and the Idea of Peace  

### Edgar “Pacificus” — The Peacemaker King  

Under King **Edgar the Peaceable (r.959–975)**, England experienced rare stability. Yet “peaceable” (*pacificus*) should be read, Burns stresses, as **“peacemaker”**, not pacifist — peace enforced by violence.  

Edgar’s reign exemplified **Christian kingship fused with Germanic heroism**. A short poem in the *Anglo-Saxon Chronicle* commemorates his coronation at Bath in 973:  

> “Edgar, ruler of the Angles, was consecrated with great ceremony  
> In the ancient city the Romans called Aquae Sulis [Bath]...  
> A thousand winters from Christ’s birth had passed save seven and twenty.”  

The poem blends **Christian millennialism** and **Germanic poetic diction**: alliterative half-lines, formulaic epithets (“ruler of men”), and temporal numerology.  

> **Mini-Essay — Syncretic Sovereignty**  
> The Bath coronation poem fuses **three legitimising lineages**: the divine rule of Christ, the imperial grandeur of Rome, and the dynastic succession of Wessex. Its martial lexicon sanctifies priests as warriors — “a *heap* of monks,” Burns notes, invoking the Old English *heap* (army). Christian worship becomes a continuation of the heroic past.

## III. Æthelred and the Crisis of Rule  

### Æthelred “Unræd” — “Ill-Advised,” Not “Unready”  

Burns dismantles the schoolbook caricature of **Æthelred the Unready**. His epithet *unræd* puns on his name *Æthelred* (“noble counsel”): it means **“noble counsel, ill-counselled”** — a king betrayed by his advisers rather than incapable himself.  

His reign (978–1016) saw renewed Viking attacks, culminating in **tribute payments (Danegeld)** and disastrous truces. A surviving **law code** records the first formal peace treaty between Æthelred and the Viking fleet:  

> “A general truce shall be established between King Æthelred and all his subjects and the whole Viking fleet to which the King has paid tribute…” (I Æthelred, c.991)  

One clause warns that anyone in England who helps Danish raiders “shall be treated as an enemy.”  

> **Mini-Essay — The Enemy Within**  
> This clause reveals a new **ethnic anxiety**: Danes settled in England were now viewed as potential traitors. What had once been a shared Germanic identity — “of one bone and blood” — becomes a rhetoric of difference. The poem’s legalism disguises xenophobia: the birth of England’s first race law.

---

## IV. The Saint Brice’s Day Massacre (1002)  

In 1002 Æthelred ordered the execution of all Danes in England — an event the *Anglo-Saxon Chronicle* defends as necessary.  

> “The King ordered that all Danes be killed on St Brice’s Day because he had learned that they conspired to kill him and his counsellors.” (*ASC* s.a. 1002)  

A royal **charter** further justifies the killings:  

> “All the Danes who have sprung up in this island, sprouting like cockle among the wheat, were to be destroyed by a most just extermination.”  

The charter’s horror lies in its rhetoric: **metaphor as moral cover**. The Danes become weeds, their murder “a just extermination.”  

Archaeological evidence corroborates the event: a **mass grave of 37 men** discovered on land owned by St John’s College, Oxford, in 2008, carbon-dated to c.1000–1020. The bodies — mostly young males with sword wounds — likely victims of the massacre (Burns 2025).  

> **Mini-Essay — Language of Erasure**  
> The Saint Brice’s Day decree performs linguistic violence before physical. “Sprouting like cockle among the wheat” dehumanises the Danes into agricultural blight. The rhetoric anticipates the justifications of modern genocide — moral purification by extermination.

---

## V. Maldon and the Ethics of Loyalty  

### The Battle of Maldon (991)  

Composed soon after the English defeat by Viking raiders at Maldon, **The Battle of Maldon** transforms historical failure into moral drama.  

When offered peace for gold, the English commander **Byrhtnoth** refuses:  

> “Here stands unafraid a noble man with his troop  
> Who will defend this homeland, my lord’s land and people.  
> The heathen must fall at battle. It seems hateful to me  
> That you should go to your ships with our treasures without a fight.”  

Byrhtnoth’s rhetoric of *lof* (praise, honour) fuses Christian virtue with heroic pride.  

> **Mini-Essay — Heroism and Hubris**  
> The poem’s grandeur is shadowed by irony: Byrhtnoth’s insistence on “over-mōd” (excess of courage) leads to his death. Burns reads *Maldon* as both **praise and critique** — a meditation on the cost of heroic ethics in an age of decline.

### Flight and Betrayal  

The poem condemns two warriors, **Godric and his brothers**, who flee the battle using Byrhtnoth’s horse:  

> “They cared not for the fight, but fled to the woods.”  

Their cowardice mirrors the failures of Æthelred’s aldermen. The poem’s obsession with loyalty — measured by **gifts and obligation** — evokes **Beowulf’s** closing scene, where only Wiglaf remains true.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Economy of Loyalty**  
> In both *Maldon* and *Beowulf*, lordship is transactional: warriors owe their lives to the man who gave them treasure. The failure of reciprocity signals moral collapse — the death of the heroic world.

---

## VI. The Wolf’s Sermon: Archbishop Wulfstan’s *Sermo Lupi ad Anglos*  

Delivered c.1010–1016, Wulfstan’s *Sermon of the Wolf to the English* (*Sermo Lupi ad Anglos*) laments national sin and divine retribution:  

> “Beloved men, recognise what is true: this world hastens to its end, and the longer it lasts, the worse it will be... For many years now the devil has led this nation too far astray, and there has been little loyalty among men.” (Wulfstan, *Sermo Lupi*)  

Wulfstan interprets Viking devastation as **God’s punishment for disunity**. Burns emphasises its performance context: rhythmic prose, repetitive vocatives (*leofe men*), and escalating syntax designed for orality.  

> **Mini-Essay — Sermon as Social Mirror**  
> Wulfstan’s “Wolf Sermon” translates catastrophe into theology. By turning defeat into divine judgment, he preserves meaning amid ruin. The text’s urgency — its “rhythmic hammering of guilt” — anticipates later apocalyptic preaching.  

---

## VII. From Anglo-Saxon to Anglo-Norman: Continuity and Change  

### Language in Transition  

The Norman Conquest (1066) did not erase English overnight. **Old English** persisted as a written and spoken vernacular well into the twelfth century. Yet **Anglo-Norman French** — the dialect of the conquerors — began to dominate administration and culture.  

The earliest borrowed French words denote entertainment and service — *juggler*, *feast*, *servant* — revealing class asymmetry. “The working classes still spoke English,” Burns explains, “and learned French only as needed to survive” (Burns 2025).  

### *The Rhyme of King William* (1087)  

A poem in the *Anglo-Saxon Chronicle* commemorating the death of **William the Conqueror** marks the blending of old and new idioms. It opens:  

> “He allowed castles to be built and wretched men to work the land;  
> The King was just, but harsh...”  

This is no panegyric. Instead, it condemns William’s **greed, taxation, and forest laws**:  

> “Whoever slew a hart or hind was to be blinded.  
> He forbade the hares to be hunted; they ran about freely.  
> Men lamented his authority, yet he cared nothing for their pain.”  

The poem’s rhyme and rhythm betray **French influence** — an experiment in end-rhyme foreign to classical Old English alliterative form. Early editors even denied it was English verse.  

> **Mini-Essay — Form as Protest**  
> The poem’s hybrid prosody becomes political: the fusion of French rhyme with English diction enacts social critique. As Seth Lerer argues, “It makes social criticism out of formal pattern.” The imported rhyme literally disrupts the old order.  

### Castles and Colonialism  

The poem’s first word, *castelas*, already foreign, signals occupation. Burns compares the castle’s arrival to the alien ship in *Independence Day*: “a colossal military installation hovering above your town.” The poem’s resentment of fortification — and of linguistic invasion — captures **colonial anxiety** centuries before empire.  

---

## VIII. Instructions for Christians — Learning as Moral Duty  

The final Old English poem copied in the twelfth century, *Instructions for Christians* (Cambridge, UL Ii.1.33), is a didactic text urging the wise to teach before death:  

> “He who may learn and will not, is hateful to God...  
> The hidden good is not wholly good if it is concealed.”  

Its verse is rhythmically uneven, more rhymed than alliterative, marking the **dissolution of Old English poetics**.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Ethics of Learning**  
> Burns ends by reading this humble poem as a parable for students themselves: knowledge is a form of stewardship. “If you can learn and choose not to, you are in trouble,” she jokes — but the message is serious. Old English literature ends not in conquest but in **pedagogy**: the persistence of wisdom amid linguistic change.  

---

## Conclusion: Survival and Transformation  

By 1100, England’s language, politics, and literature had changed beyond recognition. Yet the **Old English imagination** — its concern for loyalty, wisdom, and divine justice — endured. The Norman invasion may have fractured the world, but it also ensured its continuity: copying, translating, and teaching became acts of survival.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Last Scribes**  
> The monks who copied *Beowulf* and *Maldon* were already living in a world of French castles and new kings. Yet they persisted in writing English — not to preserve the past but to remind the future that every conquest begins and ends in words.  

## Motif Tracker  

| **Motif** | **Example(s)** | **Interpretive Use** |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Kingship and Christ** | Edgar’s Bath coronation poem | Secular rulership mirrored through divine kingship; poetic syncretism of Germanic and Christian ideals. |
| **Loyalty and Betrayal** | *The Battle of Maldon*; *Sermo Lupi ad Anglos* | Heroic ethics transformed into moral allegory; betrayal as both political failure and spiritual sin. |
| **Violence and Penance** | Saint Brice’s Day massacre; Wulfstan’s sermon | Political atrocity reframed through penitential rhetoric; language as justification for violence. |
| **Ethnic Difference / “Enemy Within”** | Æthelred’s law code (I Æthelred) | Emergence of ethnic exclusion in legal discourse; linguistic invention of race. |
| **Language Change** | *The Rhyme of King William* | Formal hybridity (rhyme + alliteration) mirrors linguistic and political transition post-1066. |
| **Ruins and Continuity** | Bath’s Roman setting; castles as alien intrusions | Architecture as palimpsest of conquest; the persistence of Englishness amid invasion. |
| **Instruction and Knowledge** | *Instructions for Christians* | Pedagogy as survival; education equated with moral salvation. |
| **Gender and Transformation** | Ælfric’s *Life of St Eugenia* | Sanctity as gendered transcendence; theological and queer readings of spiritual disguise. |
| **Apocalypse and Renewal** | Wulfstan’s *Sermo Lupi* | Eschatological anxiety turned to moral exhortation; literature as resistance to despair. |

## Critical Lenses  

| **Axis** | **Relationship** | **Implication** |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Pagan ↔ Christian** | Continuity of diction and imagery | Anglo-Saxon poetic form sanctified into Christian theology. |
| **Heroic ↔ Monastic** | Byrhtnoth vs. Ælfric | Conflict between martial and contemplative ideals of virtue. |
| **Ethnic Identity ↔ Empire** | “Bone and blood” → “cockle among the wheat” | Invention of Englishness through exclusion of the Danish Other. |
| **Violence ↔ Peace** | Edgar’s “peacemaking” through threat | Kingship legitimised by military display; paradox of pacificus. |
| **Copying ↔ Creation** | Manuscript culture and survival | Acts of transmission as reinvention; copying equals cultural continuity. |
| **Faith ↔ Fear** | *Sermo Lupi* and *Maldon* | Religious interpretation of catastrophe; sin as national narrative. |
| **Old English ↔ Anglo-Norman** | *Rhyme of King William*; borrowed French lexicon | Bilingual poetics as symptom of conquest and creative fusion. |
| **Knowledge ↔ Salvation** | *Instructions for Christians* | Education and learning framed as divine duty; wisdom as enduring virtue. |

## Exam Relevance  

### For Oxford Prelims Paper 2 (650–1350)

- Demonstrates **cultural continuity and transformation**: from monastic reform to Norman colonisation.  
- Builds historical and linguistic awareness essential for **dating and contextualising texts**.  
- Offers models of **genre comparison**: heroic poem, sermon, law code, elegy, and hybrid chronicle verse.  
- Illuminates **themes of ethnicity, kingship, and loyalty** in relation to changing language and power.  

### Analytical Skills  

- Relating **historical crisis to literary form** (law codes → ideology, sermons → rhetoric).  
- Recognising **the persistence of Old English poetics** into Middle English contexts.  
- Understanding **language change as literary event**, not merely historical.  
- Using material evidence (e.g., the Oxford mass grave) to support literary interpretation.  

### Model Essay Patterns  

1. **“The literature of late Anglo-Saxon England is written in the shadow of conquest.”**  
   — Analyse how texts from *Maldon* to *The Rhyme of King William* negotiate trauma and continuity.  

2. **“Violence is the condition of peace in the late Anglo-Saxon imagination.”**  
   — Discuss the paradox of kingship in Edgar’s and Æthelred’s reigns.  

3. **“Old English never dies — it evolves.”**  
   — Examine linguistic hybridity in post-1066 verse and its implications for literary history.  

4. **“Loyalty is the last virtue in a faithless world.”**  
   — Compare *The Battle of Maldon* and *Sermo Lupi ad Anglos* as moral meditations on collapse.  

### Revision Strategies  

- Trace the **chronological chain**: Ælfric → Edgar → Æthelred → Wulfstan → *Maldon* → *Rhyme of King William* → *Instructions for Christians*.  
- Note shifts in **form** (from alliterative to rhymed verse) as evidence of changing linguistic contact.  
- Practice quoting **Old English formulae** (“lof,” “leofe men,” “lord and retainer”) to show close reading and awareness of vocabulary.  
- Think about **historical reception** — why monks kept copying texts like *Beowulf* in the age of castles.
