## Introduction: The Fugitive Form  

This lecture introduces students to the critical reading of **drama and performance**, exploring how these two interrelated forms generate and communicate meaning.  
Its central question: *why do we need both terms*?  

A **play** can mean either a written script or a live event. Yet neither can fully exist without the other.  
The written play is incomplete without its embodiment in performance; each performance, in turn, realises only one of the infinite possibilities latent in the text:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.  

The play is thus a **fugitive form** — forever escaping fixity between writing and staging, script and event.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Incomplete Object**  
> Drama’s ontology is double. The text exists in time as a book but also in space as gesture, sound, and light.  
> Reading drama therefore means reading *potentiality*: words awaiting incarnation, and bodies awaiting interpretation.  

---

## I. The Problem of Reading Performance  

Reading a written text seems straightforward, but what does it mean to “read” a performance?  
Performance comprises not only words but **bodies, voices, design, sound, and audience** — an ecology of semiotic systems.  
The Greek root *theatron* means “place of looking,” and shares an etymology with *theory*: both describe the act of observation:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.  

Thus, to “read” performance requires negotiating two modes:  
1. The **spectator’s gaze**, a direct experience of physical event.  
2. The **theorist’s reflection**, an abstract reconstruction of that event.  

> **Mini-Essay — Seeing and Thinking**  
> Theatre demands both perception and speculation.  
> The critic reads not only the text but also the gestures and spaces that make words visible.  

---

## II. Eric Bentley’s Formula  

In 1960, theatre theorist **Eric Bentley** proposed a minimalist formula:  
> “A impersonates B while C looks on.”:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

This formula captures theatre’s triangular relationship among actor (A), character (B), and audience (C).  
It reveals that drama differs from other literary forms because its meaning arises **between** participants, not solely from language.  

Bentley’s model foregrounds two verbs:  
- **“Impersonates”** — implying artifice, imitation, play.  
- **“Looks on”** — suggesting spectatorship, passivity, and judgement.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Triangular Contract**  
> Theatre’s power emerges from reciprocity.  
> The actor lends body to fiction; the audience lends belief.  
> Meaning flickers in the interval between seeing and knowing it is false.  

However, Bentley’s formula has limits:  
- What if C is not a single spectator but a crowd?  
- Where does the playwright (the absent “D”) fit?  
- How do set, light, and architecture mediate the exchange?  

To answer these, the lecture introduces two critical frameworks: **semiotics** and **phenomenology**.

---

## III. Semiotics: Theatre as System of Signs  

### 1. From Saussure to the Stage  

**Ferdinand de Saussure’s** linguistics distinguished *signifier* (sound or image) from *signified* (concept).  
Theatre semioticians adapted this to analyse how performance communicates through visual and aural codes.  

**Keir Elam’s *The Semiotics of Theatre and Drama* (1980)** proposed that “everything on stage is a sign.”  
Elam itemised thirteen *signifying systems*:  
> Words, delivery, facial expression, gesture, movement, makeup, hairstyle, costume, properties, sets, lighting, music, and sound effects:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.  

Elam divides them into:  
- **Actor-related signs** — emanating from the body and voice.  
- **Space-related signs** — generated by the stage and its environment.  

This taxonomy offers a **toolkit** for close analysis of how theatrical meaning is made.  

> **Mini-Essay — Reading the Stage as Text**  
> Semiotics trains us to see the stage as a written page translated into multiple codes.  
> Every prop, pause, or shadow functions like punctuation in the visual grammar of performance.  

### 2. Sarah Kane’s *Phaedra’s Love* (1996)  

To demonstrate, the lecturer analyses the silent opening of **Sarah Kane’s *Phaedra’s Love***:  
> Hippolytus lounges on a sofa amid empty crisp packets and underwear, eating a hamburger, watching violent television:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.  

No dialogue occurs; the absence of “words” is itself meaningful.  
The prince, a modern Hippolytus, gorges on consumption — both food and media.  

The signs (flickering TV light, littered floor, sound of violence) construct a world of moral decay.  
The semiotic detail — a sneeze stifled with a sock — reveals character through gesture: banality elevated into metaphor.  

> **Mini-Essay — Banality as Sign**  
> Kane’s meticulous stage directions replace psychological realism with semiotic precision.  
> Modern royalty appears not heroic but grotesquely ordinary; consumption becomes pathology.  

Kane’s control of visual detail proves that meaning in performance need not depend on speech.  
However, the example also **warns against the limits** of semiotics: not all meaning can be charted.  

---

## IV. Beyond Words: Architecture and Framing  

**Martin Esslin**, another semiotician, argued that a sign must be *recognised* as such; therefore, theatre’s **frame** is crucial.  
Framing signs include: theatre architecture, lighting before the curtain, programmes, and advertising.  

A *proscenium arch* theatre (e.g., the Royal Opera House) separates audience and stage, elevating the spectacle.  
An *open or thrust stage* (e.g., the National Theatre’s Olivier) creates intimacy but also distance through scale.  
A *black box* theatre, by contrast, produces immediacy and risk, minimising hierarchy:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.  

> **Mini-Essay — Architecture as Argument**  
> The building itself makes meaning: gold gilt asserts exclusivity; bare brick signals democracy.  
> To read performance is to read its architecture — every frame is ideology made visible.  

Early modern theatres like the **Globe** differed radically: open-air spaces, shared light between actor and spectator.  
Modern indoor theatres, darkening the auditorium, isolate the audience and focus attention.  
The **frame of light** thus alters the play’s social contract: who sees whom, and who can look back.

---

## V. The Actor as Sign  

Esslin called the actor the **“iconic sign par excellence”**: a real person representing a person:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}.  
Actors signify both themselves and the characters they play; meaning arises from the tension between the two.  

For instance, when **Jude Law** plays *Hamlet*, the audience sees both Shakespeare’s prince and a modern celebrity.  
Race, gender, and age transform the sign’s meaning.  

> **Mini-Essay — Casting as Semiotics**  
> Every performance is an act of visual argument.  
> Casting redefines character; physicality and biography rewrite the text.  
> The actor’s body is not neutral — it carries histories that audiences read.

Semiotic analysis of casting thus exposes theatre as a site where identity itself is performed and reinterpreted.

---

## VI. Metatheatre and Semiotic Play — *The Two Gentlemen of Verona*  

In Shakespeare’s *Two Gentlemen of Verona*, the servant Launce performs a mock farewell using shoes and a hat to represent his family:  

> “This shoe is my father… This shoe with the hole in it is my mother… this staff is my sister… and I am the dog.”:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  

Launce’s comic confusion dramatizes representation itself: props stand for people; the actor for character.  
The scene becomes **metatheatrical**, a play about playing.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Fool as Theorist**  
> Launce’s farce literalises semiotics. He tests what a sign can mean and how resemblance collapses into absurdity.  
> Shakespeare’s clown becomes a proto-theorist, parodying the logic of representation while revealing its emotional truth.  

The gag also externalises emotion. Launce’s muddled symbols express homesickness more vividly than introspective monologue:  
selfhood, Shakespeare suggests, is defined by our external relations, not interior essence.

---

## VII. From Semiotics to Phenomenology  

Semiotics dissects performance into codes but neglects **how it feels**.  
The critic **Bert O. States**, in *Great Reckonings in Little Rooms* (1985), proposed a corrective: phenomenology:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}.  

Phenomenology studies perception — not the world as it exists, but as it is **experienced through the body**.  
States argues that reducing theatre to language “dissects the perceptual impression” and misses its affective power.  
Following **Maurice Merleau-Ponty**, he insists:  
> “To perceive is to render oneself present to something through the body.”  

> **Mini-Essay — The Living Encounter**  
> Theatre is not a system of signs but a meeting of presences.  
> Meaning arises from proximity, temperature, light, breath — the corporeal texture of experience.  

Where Elam claimed “everything on stage is a sign,” States counters that some things **resist** semiotic reading — particularly animals, children, and physical objects that remain stubbornly themselves.

---

## VIII. The Phenomenology of the Dog  

In *The Two Gentlemen of Verona*, Launce’s dog Crab “steals the show” precisely because he does **nothing**.  
The animal, unaware of acting, disrupts illusion.  
A yawn or tail wag becomes delightful because it is *real*.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Reality Effect**  
> The dog reveals theatre’s paradox: we applaud authenticity in the midst of artifice.  
> Performance succeeds not by perfect imitation but by the friction between fiction and fact.  

The living dog thus exposes the limits of Bentley’s formula: A does not impersonate B; sometimes A simply *is* A while C looks on.  
Phenomenology reminds us that **presence itself** can create meaning beyond representation.

---

## IX. Phenomenology and Perception — *King Lear*  

To demonstrate phenomenological reading, the lecture turns to the **Dover Cliff scene** in *King Lear* (Act IV, Scene 6):contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}.  
Blind Gloucester, led by his disguised son Edgar, believes he stands on a cliff’s edge.  
The audience, seeing a flat stage, must imagine the precipice through Edgar’s words:  

> “Look how we labour; methinks the ground is even horrible steep.”  

Edgar’s elaborate description becomes a verbal set design, but the stage remains unchanged.  
Later, when Gloucester “falls” on level ground, the illusion collapses.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Failure of Semiotics**  
> The scene demonstrates that signification alone cannot produce reality.  
> The body knows better than the eye; Gloucester’s proprioception (sense of spatial orientation) refuses the trick.  

Edgar’s ruse fails to cure his father’s despair precisely because it neglects bodily truth.  
The senses resist representation: Gloucester has heard the fall but not *felt* it.  
Phenomenology therefore restores the **centrality of the spectator’s and actor’s bodies** to theatrical meaning.  

---

## X. The Binocular Vision: Combining Semiotics and Phenomenology  

States recommends “**binocular vision**”: reading performance through both systems at once.  
Semiotics reveals how meaning is constructed; phenomenology shows how it is *felt*.  
Together they account for both theatre’s **intelligibility** and its **affect**.  

> **Mini-Essay — Reading with Two Eyes**  
> One eye analyses the stage as sign; the other attends to the body’s response.  
> Drama lives in the oscillation between intellect and sensation — a double vision of meaning and feeling.  

---

## Conclusion: Reading the Living Text  

To study drama is to read movement, space, and silence alongside words.  
The play is both a script and a performance; its meanings are semiotic structures animated by phenomenological presence.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Ethics of Attention**  
> Drama demands attentiveness: to architecture, to gesture, to the bodies that think before they speak.  
> To “read performance” is to honour the fleeting, embodied intelligence of theatre — a living text that breathes and dies anew each night.

## Motif Tracker  

| **Motif** | **Example(s)** | **Interpretive Use** |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Theatrical Triangle** | Eric Bentley’s “A impersonates B while C looks on” | Defines theatre as triadic relationship between actor, character, and audience. |
| **System of Signs** | Keir Elam’s semiotics; Kane’s *Phaedra’s Love* | Every element of staging becomes signifier; the stage read as text. |
| **Silence and Gesture** | Opening of *Phaedra’s Love* | Non-verbal meaning as structural language; the eloquence of inaction. |
| **Architecture and Frame** | Proscenium, thrust, and black-box stages | Spatial form as ideological argument; theatre design produces social meaning. |
| **Actor as Iconic Sign** | Jude Law’s *Hamlet*; casting across gender and race | The actor’s body carries semiotic weight beyond text; performance redefines identity. |
| **Metatheatre** | Launce’s speech in *Two Gentlemen of Verona* | Drama reflecting on its own mechanisms; the clown as theorist of representation. |
| **Phenomenological Presence** | Bert O. States; the dog Crab | Reality within fiction; material presence as surplus meaning. |
| **Embodied Perception** | *King Lear*’s Dover Cliff | The body as truth beyond illusion; proprioception defeating representation. |
| **Binocular Vision** | Combining semiotics and phenomenology | Balanced criticism integrating structural analysis and lived experience. |
| **Ethics of Attention** | Final conclusion | The critic’s role as observer-participant; reading theatre as act of care. |

## Critical Lenses  

| **Axis** | **Relationship** | **Implication** |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Text ↔ Performance** | Script and embodiment | Literature understood as potential action; interpretation enacted in time. |
| **Sign ↔ Presence** | Semiotics versus phenomenology | Theatre as tension between reading and witnessing; meaning and affect. |
| **Actor ↔ Character** | Dual identity of the performer | Performance as unstable blend of real and fictional selves. |
| **Space ↔ Ideology** | Stage architecture as social frame | Theatres embody political hierarchies or egalitarian ideals. |
| **Speech ↔ Silence** | Kane’s opening tableau | Absence of dialogue as alternative form of expression. |
| **Vision ↔ Imagination** | *King Lear*’s cliff scene | Spectatorship as creative collaboration; seeing what is not there. |
| **Reality ↔ Illusion** | The dog Crab | Physical authenticity disrupting fiction; presence as event. |
| **Intellect ↔ Emotion** | Semiotic analysis versus phenomenological response | Complete reading requires both analytic distance and affective immersion. |

## Exam Relevance  

### Core Relevance to Prelims Paper 3 (1830–1910)  

- Introduces key frameworks for **drama and performance analysis**.  
- Bridges **literary reading** and **theatrical experience** — essential for essays on nineteenth-century theatre, realism, and modern performance.  
- Equips students to analyse both **scripts** and **staging** in Paper 3 questions.  
- Encourages awareness of **historical and spatial context** — the politics of the playhouse.  

### Analytical Skills  

- Using **semiotic vocabulary** (sign, signifier, code, frame).  
- Reading **stage directions, silence, gesture** as textual evidence.  
- Recognising the **actor’s body** and **architecture** as integral to interpretation.  
- Balancing **critical theory** with personal response — semiotics and phenomenology combined.  

### Model Essay Patterns  

1. **“All theatre is an act of translation — from page to body.”**  
   — Discuss using semiotic and phenomenological frameworks.  

2. **“Theatre is the art of the instant.”**  
   — Explore ephemerality and presence in *King Lear* and modern drama.  

3. **“Every stage is political.”**  
   — Analyse how theatre architecture shapes meaning from the Globe to Kane’s black box.  

4. **“Meaning is felt as much as read.”**  
   — Examine the relationship between sign and sensation in performance.  

### Revision Strategies  

- Practise close-reading **stage directions** as poetry.  
- Compare multiple productions of a scene — how semiotic choices change meaning.  
- Remember **Bentley’s triangle** and **States’s binocular vision** as exam anchors.  
- Watch recordings of modern adaptations to attune your **phenomenological eye**.
