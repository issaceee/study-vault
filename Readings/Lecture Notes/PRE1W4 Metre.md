## Metre III: Non-Iambic Metres and Rhyme  
### Ushashi Dasgupta — Oxford Prelims Paper 1 & 3 (2025)

---

## Introduction: Beyond the Iamb  

In previous lectures Dasgupta examined the iambic line as the foundation of English verse.  
This lecture turns to **non-iambic metres** — trochaic, dactylic, anapaestic — and to **rhyme** as their companion structure:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  
The argument throughout is that metre and rhyme are not decorative but conceptual: they shape how meaning, grammar, and emotion move through time.

> **Mini-Essay — Why Other Metres Matter**  
> English verse has privileged the iamb because its two-beat alternation mirrors the rhythm of speech and heartbeat.  
> But, as Dasgupta notes, “non-iambic metres place greater constraints on expression,” forcing poets to invent new syntactic patterns to fit new rhythmic possibilities:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.  
> The difficulty of such metres becomes their expressive resource.

---

## I. Lines, Syntax, and the Question of the Line-End  

Jeremy Bentham once quipped: “When the lines run all the way to the right margin, it’s prose; when this fails to happen, it’s verse.”  
Yet in **metrical verse**, the line break is not arbitrary. It governs tone and thought.  
Dasgupta revisits **Wordsworth’s opening of *The Prelude*** — “Was it for this, that one / The fairest of all rivers…” — to show how a single word at a line-end (“this”) acquires existential weight by being isolated:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

> **Mini-Essay — The Pause as Meaning**  
> Ending a line on “this” suspends reference. The demonstrative dangles between past and present, expectation and disappointment.  
> A metrical pause becomes a metaphysical question: *Was it for this ?*

In free verse, line breaks can be altered at will; in metrical verse, they are **structural**.  
As Dasgupta remarks, “A good lineation isn’t a transcription device but a moral architecture — an obligation to pause where meaning resists closure.”:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

---

## II. Free Verse and the Politics of Form  

Dasgupta contrasts the fixity of metre with the ideological claims of **free verse**.  
For **Ezra Pound**, rhythm should be “a man’s own — his own counterfeiting on counterfeit bills.”  
**Richard Aldington** called free verse “the cadence a poet creates for himself,” while **D. H. Lawrence** likened metrical regularity to “drill sergeants barking orders.”  

These poets justified formal freedom as **political freedom** — a rebellion against what Aldington called “childish formality.”  
Yet Dasgupta cautions that the binary between individuality and constraint is false: “metrical poetry already contains variation; free verse depends on inherited rhythm even when it denies it”:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.

> **Mini-Essay — Liberty and Law**  
> Every free-verse line is haunted by its iambic ancestry.  
> The poem that rejects metre must still answer its ghost — an act of rebellion that confirms what it resists.

---

## III. Trochaic and Dactylic Metres  

### Trochaic  

A **trochee** reverses the iamb: / stressed + unstressed /.  
Trochaic rhythm feels incantatory, suited to songs, imperatives, and spells.  
Dasgupta notes that in English it is **harder to sustain** because the language tends naturally to end on stressed syllables.  
Hence trochaic poems often truncate the final unstressed beat — becoming *catalectic*.  

Example: Shakespeare’s *“Fear no more the heat o’ the sun”* — a perfect demonstration of the trochaic tetrameter catalectic.  
Ending on a stress (“sun,” “done,” “wages”) produces firmness and elegy at once.

> **Mini-Essay — Falling Rhythm and Finality**  
> Trochaic metre feels like descent — the motion of grief, gravity, or chant.  
> Its catalectic endings enact loss formally: the missing syllable becomes the sound of absence.

### Dactylic and Anapaestic  

A **dactyl** ( / x x ) and **anapaest** ( x x / ) generate triple time — the “skipping beat.”  
Dasgupta calls them “the metres of motion, laughter, and lamentation,” but also “the hardest to sustain in English,” whose stress patterns are binary:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.  

**Shelley’s “To a Skylark”** exemplifies the problem: nominally dactylic, it continually shortens or overruns its pattern.  
Each stanza closes with a longer line (“…in profuse strains of unpremeditated art”) that breaks the rhythm to end the pursuit of the bird’s “ungraspable song.”  

**Longfellow’s *Song of Hiawatha*** (1855) demonstrates both the power and monotony of sustained trochaic tetrameter.  
Its hypnotic rhythm — “By the shore of Gitche Gumee, / By the shining Big-Sea-Water” — drew on Finnish sources but imposed a colonial fantasy of “Native” cadence.  
Modern critics, Dasgupta notes, read its repetitions as both **appropriation** and **memorial**: a rhythm that records what it silences:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.

> **Mini-Essay — Rhythm and Empire**  
> Longfellow’s metre tries to “honour” indigenous song yet standardises it into European symmetry.  
> Metre here is not neutral pattern but ideology: the beat of cultural translation.

---

## IV. The Imperative Metre: Donne and Auden  

**John Donne’s “Go and catch a falling star”** (c.1600) uses the same trochaic-dactylic compound pattern.  
Its rhythm, half-command, half-lullaby, sets impossible tasks:  

> “Go and catch a falling star, / Get with child a mandrake root…”  

Each stanza truncates its last line — again *catalectic* — producing what Dasgupta calls “open-ended sound suggestive of falling away.”:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
The poem’s cynicism about constancy is softened by the meter’s sing-song charm.  

**W. H. Auden’s “Lullaby”** (1937) reworks the same pattern:  

> “Lay your sleeping head, my love, / Human on my faithless arm.”  

Dasgupta highlights the **chain of imperatives** (“lay,” “sleep,” “let”) that link Auden to Donne.  
Both use falling rhythm to voice tenderness shadowed by loss.  
The metre’s unresolved cadence mirrors erotic transience — what Dasgupta calls “temporal impoverishment”: every lullaby is also elegy:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}.

> **Mini-Essay — Falling Rhythms, Falling Worlds**  
> Because the trochaic line ends unstressed, it always falls away.  
> Its motion figures impermanence — the erotic, the mortal, the incomplete.  
> Donne’s misogynist wit and Auden’s homoerotic tenderness share that formal melancholy.

---

## V. Dolnik, Nursery, and the Popular Beat  

Dasgupta introduces the Russian term **dolnik**, used by Derek Attridge to describe accentual verse that counts stresses rather than syllables.  
English nursery rhymes — “Doctor Foster went to Gloucester” — fall into this flexible pattern.  
Victorian and modern poets alike mined this rhythm for its mingled innocence and irony.  

**Tennyson’s “Locksley Hall”** (1842) stretches the metre into expansive, almost cinematic rhythm:  

> “Comrades, leave me here a little, / While as yet is early morn;  
> Leave me here, and when you want me, / Sound upon the bugle-horn.”  

Dasgupta calls this a “four-beat gallop” that oscillates between marching song and lament:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}.  
Its long lines verge on spoken prose, foreshadowing the **metrical instability** of the late nineteenth century.  

**Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s “The Cry of the Children”** (1843) mixes binary and triple metres to embody exhaustion — the rhythm of industrial labour itself.  

> **Mini-Essay — Rhythm and History**  
> The move from steady iamb to uneven dolnik mirrors industrial dislocation: poetic rhythm registers the tempo of modern life.  
> The “nearly regular” beat becomes the sound of a society out of step.

---

## VI. Dactylic Memory: Hardy’s “The Voice”  

In **Thomas Hardy’s “The Voice”** (1912) the dactylic rhythm turns elegy into echo:  

> “Woman much missed, how you call to me, call to me…”  

Each line drops two syllables at the close, leaving a hollow cadence.  
The missing beats become the sound of absence itself — “as if the poem listens into its own silence,” Dasgupta writes:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}.  

**Seamus Heaney**, in *Poems That Make Grown Men Cry* (2014), singled out Hardy’s last stanza as almost physically painful:  
the line “Can it be you that I hear?” breaks metre at the instant of recognition and doubt.  

> **Mini-Essay — Meter as Mourning**  
> Hardy’s dactyls translate grief into breath: the regular pulse falters, mimicking the body’s attempt to call the lost.  
> Metre becomes memory’s measure — the beat that persists when words fail.

---

## VII. Rhyme: Sound, Expectation, and Freedom  

### Perfect and Partial Rhyme  

Dasgupta turns from rhythm to **rhyme** as “the logic of recurrence through difference.”  
Linguistically, rhyme joins two syllables with distinct onsets but identical nuclei + codas (“cat”/“mat”).  
Yet most poets exploit **partial rhyme** — consonance, assonance, eye-rhyme — to vary predictability.  

In *In Memoriam*, Tennyson’s perfect rhymes (“must/dust,” “shade/made”) express faith in order.  
By contrast, **modern poets prefer imperfection**, what Dasgupta calls “return grounded in difference”:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}.  

### The Decline of the Perfect Rhyme  

Milton had already condemned rhyme as “the troublesome and modern bondage” (*Preface to Paradise Lost*, 1667).  
By the twentieth century, perfect rhyme felt mechanical.  
Dasgupta cites Larkin’s miniature masterpiece *“As Bad as a Mile”*:  

> “Watching the shied core strike the basket, / Skidding across the floor…”  

Its **half-rhymes** (“basket”/“back at”) turn control into entropy — rhyme as the sound of order unravelling.  

> **Mini-Essay — Predictability and Surprise**  
> Perfect rhyme gratifies; imperfect rhyme unsettles.  
> The reader’s half-met expectation becomes an analogue for modern doubt: knowledge that pattern exists, but cannot be trusted.

---

## VIII. The Gender of Rhyme  

“Masculine” rhymes end on stress (*stand/land*); “feminine” on an unstressed syllable (*feather/weather*).  
Critics once echoed Milton in calling rhyme effeminate — “petticoats for Achilles.”  
Dasgupta notes the persistence of this gendered metaphor: formal looseness equated with moral weakness.  

> **Mini-Essay — Rhyme and Gendered Labour**  
> Feminine rhyme, with its surplus syllable, performs excess — the decorative “extra” that patriarchy devalues.  
> Yet poets from Byron to Auden reclaim it as wit, proving that ornament can outthink austerity.

---

## IX. From Pope to Auden: Rhyme as Argument  

In heroic couplets, **Pope’s “reasonable rhymes”** create logical closure:  

> “Where’er you walk, cool gales shall fan the glade,  
> Trees where you sit shall crowd into a shade.”  

Kenneth Cochrane observed that such rhymes feel “unnaturally reasonable” — too complete, too symmetrical.  
Modern poets disrupt that completion.  

Auden’s *New Year Letter* (1940) and *“The Fugue”* turn rhyme into dialectic:  

> “Art in intention is mimesis,  
> But realised, the resemblance ceases.  
> Art is not life and cannot be  
> A midwife to society;  
> For art is a fait accompli.”  

The final French phrase (“fait accompli”) over-rhymes “be/society,” making rhyme itself foreign, ironic, performative.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Wit of Excess**  
> Polysyllabic rhyme, like Auden’s “society/accompli,” flirts with bad taste.  
> It shows rhyme’s evolution from moral closure to intellectual play — a structure for thinking rather than agreeing.

---

## Conclusion: Constraint and Invention  

Dasgupta ends by reframing metre and rhyme not as restrictions but as **creative conditions**.  
Each pattern — iambic, trochaic, dactylic — carries its own epistemology, a way of feeling time and truth.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Ethics of Pattern**  
> “To write in metre,” Dasgupta concludes, “is to accept rhythm as responsibility.”  
> The poet obeys the past only to discover new motion within it.  
> Freedom, paradoxically, depends on form.

## Motif Tracker  

| **Motif** | **Example(s)** | **Interpretive Use** |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Falling Rhythm / Loss** | Donne’s “Go and catch a falling star”; Auden’s “Lullaby”; Hardy’s “The Voice” | Trochaic and dactylic metres as figures of descent; rhythm mimics mortality and desire. |
| **Freedom and Constraint** | Pound’s free verse; Tennyson’s iambics; Hardy’s defence of metre | Formal pattern as a paradox of liberty: freedom discovered through obedience to structure. |
| **Rhyme and Return** | Tennyson’s *In Memoriam*; Larkin’s half-rhymes | Rhyme as temporal recurrence; faith and doubt staged as sound expectation and disruption. |
| **Gender and Form** | “Masculine” and “feminine” rhymes; Byron and Auden | Poetic gendering of rhyme exposes cultural hierarchies; excess reclaimed as intellectual play. |
| **History in Rhythm** | Longfellow’s *Song of Hiawatha*; Barrett Browning’s “The Cry of the Children” | Metre as ideological marker; rhythm records colonial and industrial tempos. |
| **Imperative and Intimacy** | Donne’s commands; Auden’s lullaby | Trochaic imperatives express both mastery and tenderness; rhythm as relation. |
| **Sound and Silence** | Hardy’s truncations; dactylic omissions | The missing beat as formal absence; silence rendered audible. |
| **Ethics of Pattern** | Dasgupta’s claim that metre is “responsibility” | Rhythm as moral attention: the poet’s discipline mirrors ethical awareness. |

---

## Critical Lenses  

| **Axis** | **Relationship** | **Implication** |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Metre ↔ Meaning** | Form generates emotion and knowledge | Rhythm not as vessel but as argument; time itself becomes theme. |
| **Pattern ↔ Deviation** | Variation within rule | Expression found in breaking expectation; beauty as controlled disobedience. |
| **Colonialism ↔ Aesthetics** | Longfellow’s imitation of “Native” chant | Metre as instrument of cultural power and appropriation. |
| **Gender ↔ Ornament** | Feminine rhyme and “decoration” | Revaluation of surplus syllable as wit, not weakness. |
| **Freedom ↔ Inheritance** | Free verse versus traditional metre | Every innovation haunted by its formal ancestry; rebellion validates the rule. |
| **Memory ↔ Sound** | Hardy’s elegiac dactyls | Metre as temporal persistence; grief measured by recurrence. |
| **Constraint ↔ Responsibility** | Dasgupta’s closing statement | Poetic discipline as moral stance: form teaches care and patience. |

## Exam Relevance  

### Core Relevance to Prelims Papers 1 and 3  

- Demonstrates deep formal analysis for close-reading papers: **metrical scanning, rhyme schemes, and lineation**.  
- Links **metrical variation** to historical, political, and emotional meanings.  
- Builds bridges between **early and modern verse traditions**, showing continuity of experiment.  
- Encourages discussion of **form as ethics** — how restraint produces originality.  

### Analytical Skills  

- Performing scansion and relating rhythm to tone or syntax.  
- Recognising how **metre encodes ideology** — colonial, gendered, or aesthetic.  
- Describing **rhyme types** (perfect, partial, eye, assonance) with interpretive precision.  
- Using **comparative reading** to link Donne, Hardy, Auden, and free-verse modernists.  

### Model Essay Patterns  

1. **“Falling rhythms express both tenderness and loss.”** — Compare Donne, Auden, and Hardy.  
2. **“Freedom is found in obedience.”** — Discuss the paradox of constraint in metrical form.  
3. **“Rhyme is the sound of history repeating itself.”** — Trace rhyme’s evolution from Tennyson to Larkin.  
4. **“Every metre carries its own morality.”** — Explore Dasgupta’s claim that form is ethical attention.  

### Revision Strategies  

- Practise scanning lines of different metres aloud — trochaic, dactylic, anapaestic.  
- Identify **catalexis** (truncated line-endings) and how they affect tone.  
- Compare poets’ uses of imperfect rhyme: how modern dissonance revises Victorian order.  
- Review poems where **metre and subject diverge** (e.g., playful rhythm with tragic content).
