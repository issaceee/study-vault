## Oscar Wilde and Sexuality: The Love That Dare Not Speak Its Name  
### Oxford Prelims Paper 3 (1830–1910) — Fergus McGhee, 2025  

---

## Introduction: Wilde, Identity, and Anachronism  

Oscar Wilde remains one of the most recognisable figures of modern sexual history. Yet, as Fergus McGhee cautions, “**Wilde as the first modern homosexual**” is as much a **retrospective invention** as a historical fact (McGhee 2025).  

Following the 1895 trials, Wilde became synonymous with “the homosexual” — a new type produced by the **pathologising discourse of sexology**. As **Alan Sinfield** argues, the idea of homosexuality as a totalising identity, complete with “attributes, habits, and pathology,” was **manufactured at the fin de siècle**, not discovered (Sinfield 1994).  

Before this invention, there existed **acts**, not identities — “same-sex desire,” not “homosexuality.” The notion that Wilde “embodied” an essence called gayness belongs to a post-1895 culture of **classification and moral panic**.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Invention of Visibility**  
> Wilde did not *become* the homosexual type; he was *typed* as it. The Wildean qualities — aestheticism, wit, effeminacy — retrospectively coded as “gay” were, in the 1880s, attributes of artistic excess, even heterosexual sensuality. Visibility, paradoxically, was created by scandal.

## I. Before the Trials: Desire, Ambiguity, and the “Grey Area”  

### The Culture of Unspeakability  

McGhee stresses that **same-sex acts** were criminal long before 1895, but **homosexual identity** as such was unthinkable. The “unspeakability” of same-sex desire paradoxically enabled speech through **irony, allusion, and art**.  

In the **1871 trial of Ernest Boulton and Frederick Park** (“Fanny and Stella”), the defence appealed to the jury’s patriotic denial of such acts:  

> “Gentlemen, I call upon you to pronounce by your verdict that they libel the morality and character of this country who say that that plague exists... that London is not cursed with the sins of Sodom or Westminster tainted with the vices of Gomorrah.” (The Queen v. Boulton, 1871, qtd. in Cohen 1996, p.97; see also Wilde Lecture 4 Handout, p.1)  

The jury complied. The denial that homosexuality “existed” produced what McGhee calls a **“grey area”** — a tacit safe space in which same-sex desire could circulate indirectly.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Productive Closet**  
> Silence created freedom. By refusing to name same-sex desire, late Victorian society left space for it to thrive as **subtext** — in conversation, in art, in knowing glances. Wilde’s irony flourishes in this half-lit zone: a language “to those who know,” deniable to those who do not.  

### Wilde and the Cartoon Imagination  

An 1881 *Punch* cartoon by George du Maurier, *“Maudle on the Choice of a Profession”* (see handout, p.5), caricatures Wilde’s aesthetic philosophy through the effeminate figure “Maudle.” When Mrs. Brown insists her son “must be something,” Maudle replies: “Why should he be anything? Why not remain beauty?”  

The joke hinges on art’s alleged **corrupting power** — a decade before Wilde’s first sexual scandal. The cartoon predates any documented homosexual relationships, showing how Wilde was already imagined as the **seducer of youth**, the aesthete who undermines masculinity.  

> **Mini-Essay — Hindsight and Projection**  
> Critics later read such caricatures as prophetic of Wilde’s trials, but McGhee insists this is anachronism. What du Maurier mocks is not sexual deviance but aesthetic uselessness — the *threat of art itself*.  

---

## II. From Acts to Identity: Pathology and Performance  

### The Petition from Prison  

After his conviction for “gross indecency” (under the 1885 Labouchere Amendment), Wilde’s 1896 **petition to the Home Secretary** betrays internalised pathology:  

> “He does not attempt to palliate the offences of which he was rightly found guilty, but to point out that such offences are forms of sexual madness... diseases to be cured by a physician, not crimes to be punished by a judge.” (Wilde, *Letter to the Home Secretary*, 2 June 1896; Holland & Hart-Davis 2000, p.656; handout p.1)  

Here Wilde adopts the very **medicalising discourse** he resisted in his art. McGhee calls this “the tragedy of capitulation”: a man whose writings dissolved categories forced to describe himself in the language of pathology.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Pathologised Artist**  
> Wilde’s plea transforms sin into sickness, vice into symptom. His petition shows how thoroughly the new science of sex had colonised subjectivity — even the artist of ambiguity compelled to claim diagnosis as mercy.  

### “The Love That Dare Not Speak Its Name”  

At his trial, Wilde delivered one of the most celebrated — and ambiguous — defences in literary history:  

> “It is that deep, spiritual affection that is pure as it is perfect... misunderstood, so much misunderstood, that it may be described as the ‘love that dare not speak its name,’ and on account of it I am placed where I am now.” (Hyde 1973, p.201; handout p.2)  

The speech reclaims same-sex love as **intellectual and artistic** rather than carnal, linking it to **Plato, Michelangelo, and Shakespeare**. Yet its emphasis on “purity” and “intellect” invites multiple readings: defence, denial, and redefinition at once.  

> **Mini-Essay — Speaking and Unspeaking Love**  
> Wilde elevates eros into philosophy but also desexualises it. His rhetoric, both bold and evasive, performs what McGhee calls “the ethics of the unsaid” — a poetics of desire constrained by legality yet liberated through art.

## III. Reading Wilde’s Sexual Aesthetics  

### The Portrait of Mr W. H. (1889) — Desire and Proof  

In *The Portrait of Mr W. H.*, Wilde’s fictional essayists propose that **Shakespeare’s sonnets** were written to a young actor, “Willie Hughes,” who played female roles onstage.  

Cyril Graham, the theory’s originator, fabricates a portrait of the boy to “prove” his thesis; when the forgery is exposed, he dies by suicide, and his friends in turn oscillate between scepticism and belief.  

The story anticipates Wilde’s own critical philosophy: **interpretation as invention**. Its chain of forgeries mirrors the way desire produces its own evidence.  

> **Mini-Essay — Homoerotic Hermeneutics**  
> Wilde’s readers’ desire for proof — for an identifiable homosexual Shakespeare — mirrors society’s desire to *name* and *fix* Wilde. *The Portrait of Mr W. H.* turns interpretation into performance: criticism as seduction, reading as erotic act.  

When the defence lawyer Carson accused Wilde of writing an “article to show that Shakespeare’s sonnets were suggestive of unnatural vice,” Wilde replied:  

> “On the contrary, I have written an article to show that they were not.” (Hyde 1948, p.129; handout p.2)  

The denial is itself double. Wilde rejects the label “unnatural vice” but not the passion: his article had called such love “entirely natural and beautiful.”  

---

## IV. The Picture of Dorian Gray — Style, Scandal, and Censorship  

### The Lippincott’s Text (1890)  

Upon its first publication, *Dorian Gray* provoked outrage:  

> “Why go grubbing in muck heaps?... It is false art, for its interest is medico-legal... If he can write for none but outlawed noblemen and perverted telegraph-boys, the sooner he takes to tailoring the better.” (*The Scots Observer*, 5 July 1890; handout p. 2)  

The insult — “outlawed noblemen and perverted telegraph boys” — alludes to the **Cleveland Street scandal** (1889), in which aristocrats were discovered patronising a male brothel. Reviewers thus **coded same-sex desire** without naming it.  

When challenged, Wilde refused moral correction but subtly revised the text for the 1891 edition, excising explicit confessionals like Basil Hallward’s declaration:  

> “I have worshipped you with far more romance of feeling than a man usually gives to a friend... Somehow, I had never loved a woman.” (*Lippincott’s* text, 1890; handout p. 3)  

> **Mini-Essay — Revision and Repression**  
> Wilde’s excisions do not erase desire; they reframe it as **style**. The novel’s eroticism migrates from plot to prose — into colour, texture, rhythm. Style becomes the refuge of the unspeakable.  

### “False to Morality”  

In later letters to editors, moralists complained that Wilde “lacked the tact and restraint to give us the artistic representation of a hero who is half Jack the Ripper, half Gaveston” (Scots Observer letter, July 1890; handout p. 2).  

The comparison of Dorian to Gaveston — the favourite of Edward II — marks an early **critical linking of homosexuality and violence**, a pairing Wilde’s prose resists by aestheticising both.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Aesthetic of Ambiguity**  
> Wilde refuses to “distance” the reader from sin. The problem, critics said, was not that he depicted vice, but that he made it beautiful. In making vice pleasurable, *Dorian Gray* transforms morality into aesthetics — and thus destabilises both.  

---

## V. Wilde and the Stage: Rewriting the “Fallen Woman”  

### A Woman of No Importance (1893)  

Wilde adapts the popular **“fallen woman” melodrama** — typified by Dumas’s *Camille* — but reverses its moral trajectory. Mrs Arbuthnot, an unmarried mother, rejects the repentant ending expected of her genre.  

Critics were scandalised that she “left in possession of a very rich new husband” and refused repentance. Clement Scott complained: “Never before did a good woman play bad woman so well.”  

Wilde replied in an interview:  

> “It is indeed a burning shame that there should be one law for men and another for women. I think there should be no law for anybody.” (Pearson 1946, p. 251; handout p. 4)  

> **Mini-Essay — No Law for Anybody**  
> Wilde reframes morality as power: law itself is the obscenity. His women refuse moral taxonomies as his men refuse sexual ones. In rejecting repentance, Mrs Arbuthnot embodies Wilde’s creed of self-definition — ethical anarchy as liberation.  

### Lady Windermere’s Fan (1892)  

Here Wilde again rewrites the fallen woman plot. Mrs Erlynne, presumed adulteress, proves to be Lady Windermere’s mother and saves her daughter from scandal. When confronted with the moralising Lord Windermere, she retorts:  

> “Ah, yes. I remember how long ago that seems. It was done before I was married. Dark hair and an innocent expression was a fashion then.”  

Her wit transforms shame into style.  

> **Mini-Essay — Irony as Salvation**  
> Wilde replaces repentance with repartee. In Mrs Erlynne’s laughter, irony becomes ethics — a refusal of judgement through intelligence. The fallen woman becomes the most moral person onstage precisely because she rejects moral language.  

---

## VI. The Importance of Being Earnest (1895) — Double Lives and Double Meanings  

McGhee ends with Wilde’s final, and most subversive, comedy. *The Importance of Being Earnest* celebrates duplicity: every character performs a **double life**.  

“Bunburying” — the act of inventing a second identity — mirrors the double existence forced upon queer Victorians. Yet the play refuses exposure or punishment; all lies are rewarded.  

At the close, Jack discovers that he really *is* called Ernest.  

> “It is a terrible thing for a man to find out that all his life he has been speaking nothing but the truth.”  
> “Of course,” replies Gwendolen, “I feel you are sure to change.”  

> **Mini-Essay — Truth in Disguise**  
> Wilde turns farce into philosophy: every mask conceals a truer self. *Earnest* sanctifies deceit as creativity. Its world rewards invention, wit, and self-fashioning — the hallmarks of queer survival.  

In McGhee’s words, “It is gay in every possible sense: in humour, in self-creation, in defiance.” The play’s joyous artifice closes the circle opened by the trials: Wilde’s greatest defence of identity is comedy itself.  

---

## Conclusion: Wilde, Sexuality, and the Art of Self-Creation  

To read Wilde’s sexuality is to read his art. His “unspeakable” desires are not hidden meanings but **methods** — irony, doubling, performance, and aesthetic excess.  

> **Mini-Essay — Beyond the Label**  
> Wilde was not a crusader for homosexual identity but a writer for self-definition. His works resist typology: the “love that dare not speak its name” is also the *art that dares not tell one truth*.  

From the courtroom to the stage, Wilde transforms shame into spectacle, turning accusation into art.

| **Law and Pathology** | Petition to Home Secretary; Boulton & Park trial (1871) | Shows emergence of legal-medical discourse; criminalisation reframed as disease. |
| **Art and Morality** | *The Picture of Dorian Gray*; *Scots Observer* reviews | Illustrates collision of aesthetic autonomy with moral panic; beauty as ethical subversion. |
| **Performance and Doubling** | *Earnest*, “Bunburying”; *Lady Windermere’s Fan* | Theatrical doubling as model for queer self-fashioning; performance as truth. |
| **The Fallen Woman / Double Standard** | *A Woman of No Importance*; Wilde’s interviews | Challenges gendered moral codes; women’s transgression mirrors male sexual freedom. |
| **Silence and Speech** | “Dare not speak its name”; courtroom rhetoric | Tension between confession and discretion; the politics of saying nothing. |

---

## Critical Lenses  

| **Axis** | **Relationship** | **Implication** |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Aesthetics ↔ Morality** | *Dorian Gray* as scandal of beauty | Wilde collapses distinction between art and ethics; beauty as argument against virtue. |
| **Speech ↔ Silence** | “Love that dare not speak its name” | Language both conceals and creates desire; the politics of what cannot be said. |
| **Performance ↔ Authenticity** | Wilde’s theatrical persona | Identity constructed through performance; truth as artifice. |
| **Law ↔ Madness** | Wilde’s petition citing Nordau and Lombroso | Pathology legitimises persecution; Wilde’s self-medicalisation reveals internalised control. |
| **Gender ↔ Transgression** | Fallen women; aesthetic men | Wilde’s plays feminise the male aesthete and masculinise the repentant woman. |
| **Public ↔ Private** | Courtroom vs. drawing-room | The stage becomes a courtroom and vice versa; exposure as both punishment and spectacle. |
| **Comedy ↔ Tragedy** | *Earnest* versus the Trials | Wilde’s life oscillates between laughter and catastrophe; irony as both defence and weapon. |
| **Class ↔ Sexuality** | “Outlawed noblemen and perverted telegraph-boys” | Desire coded through class anxieties; queer panic intertwined with social hierarchy. |

## Exam Relevance  

### Core Relevance to Oxford Prelims Paper 3 (1830–1910)  

- Places Wilde within **Victorian discourses of sexuality, morality, and censorship**.  
- Demonstrates how **aestheticism intersects with legal and medical definitions** of deviance.  
- Highlights the evolution from **unspeakable act to named identity**, central to cultural modernity.  
- Links Wilde’s dramatic form to **queer performance, doubling, and irony**.  

### Analytical Skills  

- Reading **legal and literary language** comparatively.  
- Identifying **subtext, irony, and coded desire** in Wilde’s prose and drama.  
- Integrating **historical context** (trials, reviews, caricatures) with textual analysis.  
- Discussing **gender alongside sexuality** — “fallen woman” and “fallen man” as mirrored tropes.  

### Model Essay Patterns  

1. **“The love that dare not speak its name speaks through art.”**  
   — Analyse how Wilde’s language transforms silence into aesthetic discourse.  

2. **“Performance is Wilde’s form of confession.”**  
   — Discuss Wilde’s theatrical self-fashioning in *Earnest* and his trials.  

3. **“No law for anybody.”**  
   — Explore how Wilde’s plays destabilise gendered and moral hierarchies.  

4. **“Beauty is itself a scandal.”**  
   — Examine *Dorian Gray* as a confrontation between aesthetic pleasure and Victorian propriety.  

### Revision Strategies  

- Review **trial transcripts and petitions** alongside Wilde’s texts — law as rival narrative form.  
- Compare Wilde’s rhetoric to **contemporary sexological discourse** (Lombroso, Nordau).  
- Trace Wilde’s influence on **later queer modernism** (Forster, Huxley, Bowen).  
- Revisit his comedies for how **wit disguises seriousness** — irony as philosophy.
