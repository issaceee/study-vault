## Victorian Stuff I: Dickens and Paperwork  
### Prof. Sophie Ratcliffe — Oxford Prelims Paper 3 (1830–1910)

---

## Introduction: Literature and Material Culture  

Sophie Ratcliffe opens the *Victorian Stuff* lecture series with a confession: “I’m obsessed with paper.”  
Her aim, however, is not to talk about stationery but about **literature as material culture** — the study of *things* as carriers of meaning:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  

For Ratcliffe, *Victorian stuff* means the objects that fill nineteenth-century life — *the paraphernalia of emotion*: books, trinkets, hairpins, ledgers, curl-papers, receipts.  
She argues that by attending to such details, we recover the “small, hidden lives” that large historical narratives erase.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Archaeology of the Everyday**  
> The study of “stuff” becomes an ethical practice. To handle a scrap of paper or a torn advertisement is to touch the ordinary; the transient object restores intimacy to history.  

The lecture therefore proceeds as a tour through **paper in the nineteenth century** — its technologies, metaphors, and emotional economies — culminating in the *copy clerk* of Dickens and Joyce: the figure consumed by the very medium that defines him.

## I. The Age of Paper  

The nineteenth century, Ratcliffe notes, was literally an **“Age of Paper.”**  
Thomas Carlyle lamented that England had exchanged divine revelation for bureaucracy:  
> “Call it at least the Age of Paper… beautiful art, not only of revealing thought, but also of so beautifully hiding from us the want of thought!” (Carlyle, *The French Revolution*, 1837):contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.  

Mass production from rag pulp, advances in cheap printing, and the explosion of periodical culture filled homes and streets with bills, posters, share certificates, and novels.  
Paper meant both *communication* and *clutter* — *red tape*, waste, bureaucracy, and debt.  

Jane Frith Panton, recalling Dickens’s readings, quipped that she “had not much sympathy with paper sorrows.”  
Her phrase, Ratcliffe suggests, encapsulates Victorian ambivalence: **the fear that feeling itself might be mass-produced**:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.  

> **Mini-Essay — Paper Sorrows**  
> A “paper sorrow” is both fictional and structural — grief mediated through print, feeling flattened into commodity.  
> Yet paper also preserves; its fragility sustains empathy across centuries.  

---

## II. Dickens’s *Pickwick Papers* and the Paper World  

### The Accidental Novel  

Dickens’s first great success, *The Pickwick Papers* (1836–7), embodies the contingency of the new print economy.  
Commissioned to accompany caricatures by illustrator Robert Seymour, it became a self-replicating phenomenon: fiction born of serialization.  

Ratcliffe loves the novel’s “messiness and contingency”: a text aware of its own fragility — “paper about paper.”  

### The Bedroom Farce: Paper and the Body  

She dwells on the scene where Mr Pickwick mistakenly enters a lady’s bedroom:  
> “Standing before the dressing-glass was a middle-aged lady, in yellow curl-papers…” (*Pickwick Papers*, ch. 22):contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.  

Pickwick, perspiring in horror, retreats to a dark corridor to “wait for morning, as philosophically as he might.”  

> **Mini-Essay — Curl-Papers and Consciousness**  
> Curl-papers — literal scraps wound round hair — epitomise Dickens’s fascination with paper’s double life as thought and flesh.  
> For Pickwick, paper is cerebral (the “Papers” of knowledge); for the lady, it is bodily, intimate, absurdly material.  
> The farce exposes a clash between **paper as intellect** and **paper as matter**, mind versus body.  

Ratcliffe reads Pickwick’s humiliation as an allegory of authorship: the writer who discovers his abstract “papers” have become tangible, gendered things.  

---

## III. Curl-Papers and Serial Culture  

Curl-papers recur obsessively in Dickens: Miggs in *Barnaby Rudge* (1841) appears “a strange revelation of blue and yellow curl-papers.”:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
Such colour — blue and yellow — mirrors the *advertising leaves* bound into Dickens’s serial issues.  

When Dickens published *Master Humphrey’s Clock* (1841), the weekly parts were printed on thin blue paper, interleaved with yellow advertisements for stoves and bonnets.  
Ratcliffe reveals that **the very hues decorating women’s hair recur in the novel’s material form**.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Self-Consuming Novel**  
> Dickens feared his own fiction might become waste: paper meant to enlighten turned to paper curlers or kindling.  
> The “paper woman” thus embodies the writer’s anxiety of disposability — his art literally recycled into domestic trivia.  

Dickens called serialization “perplexing and difficult,” lamenting how the weekly format cramped both body and imagination:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.  
His novels became victims of the “City of Unlimited Paper” satirised in *Household Words* (1857), where people “marry paper wives” and eat “paper food”:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.

---

## IV. Flatness and Feeling: The Problem of Paper Characters  

Critics often describe Dickens’s characters as “flat” or lacking interiority.  
Juliet John attributes this to melodramatic form: “a lack of complexity or ‘interiority’”:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}.  
David Simpson sees them as “figures who evidence an enforced loss of the inward self in favour of outward attributes”:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}.  

Ratcliffe reframes this not as defect but design.  
Dickens’s people are **paper beings**, their surfaces the site of emotion.  

> **Mini-Essay — Flatness as Feeling**  
> In a world saturated with print, depth migrates to texture.  
> The page’s surface — repetition, typeface, list, inventory — becomes the medium of pathos.  
> Dickens’s “paper characters” express, by their very thinness, the anxiety of a culture losing thickness of self.  

---

## V. Paper Overload: Mr Snagsby in *Bleak House*  

Dickens’s most papery character is **Mr Snagsby**, the law-stationer of *Bleak House* (1852–3):  
> “In Cook’s Court… Mr Snagsby has dealt in all sorts of blank forms of legal process… in parchment, foolscap, brief, draft, brown, white, whitey-brown…”:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}.  

The endless list of goods produces both comedy and claustrophobia.  
The text chokes on its own catalogue — *forms without content*, echoing Chancery’s self-perpetuating paperwork.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Hypnotic List**  
> Dickens turns bureaucracy into litany.  The repetition of “ink, India-rubber, pounce, pins” is mesmerising, but meaning collapses into enumeration.  
> Listing becomes an aesthetic of paralysis: writing that forgets why it writes.  

The inventory, Ratcliffe observes, is a moral warning: fascination with things risks moral shade.  
Chancery’s paper world devours reality; its clerks become stationary in every sense — inert, absorbed, consumed by matter.

---

## VI. The Body Turns to Paper: Richard Carstone  

In *Bleak House*, Chancery’s plaintiff Richard Carstone confesses:  
> “I have looked well into the papers, Esther — I have been deep in them for months.”  

Esther observes that “the commentary upon it was now indelibly written in his handsome face”: his lips dry, his skin papery:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}.  
Reading the documents, Richard becomes one.  

> **Mini-Essay — Reading as Incorporation**  
> Paper seeps into the body: ink becomes complexion, bureaucracy flesh.  
> Dickens literalises the metaphor of “being absorbed” in documents — a self dissolved by the medium of information.  

---

## VII. From Dickens to Braddon and Trollope: Paper and Crime  

Mary Elizabeth Braddon’s *Lady Audley’s Secret* (1861–2) stages metamorphosis through paperwork.  
A woman falsifies her name by altering newspaper notices; later, characters’ faces blanch “to a sickly, leaden pallor” at the sight of printed revelations:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}.  
Identity becomes a function of print: to exist is to be legible.  

In Anthony Trollope’s *The Way We Live Now* (1875), paper drives financial scandal.  
Mr Melmotte forges signatures on “thin tissue paper,” later destroying the evidence:  
> “He tore [the documents] into small fragments and burned the bits… This one he chewed into a pulp till he swallowed it.”:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  

> **Mini-Essay — Eating Paper**  
> The ultimate absorption: the forger devours his own medium.  
> Paper, once instrument of exchange, becomes bodily matter — guilt ingested, text digested.  

---

## VIII. The Copy Clerk and the Machine  

Dickens’s **Nemo** in *Bleak House* is a copyist identified only by his handwriting.  
His name — Latin for “no one” — signals the erasure of personhood under clerical repetition.  
By the fin de siècle, Ratcliffe argues, this anxiety culminates in **Joyce’s “Counterparts”** (1906).  

### Joyce’s Paper Men  

Farrington, the Dublin copy clerk, spends his days transcribing contracts:  
> “He stared fixedly at the incomplete phrase: *In no case shall the said Bernard Bodley be …* and thought how strange it was that the last three words began with the same letter.”:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  

Drunk, he returns home to beat his son — the day’s mechanical violence repeated at night.  
Joyce’s title refers both to duplicated documents and to mirrored human actions.  

> **Mini-Essay — Counterparts**  
> The bureaucratic ellipsis (“…”) in Farrington’s copy mirrors the unspeakable ellipsis of the closing scene.  
> The printed mark becomes moral metaphor: trauma replicated like type, violence inherited like handwriting.  
> The story’s punctuation is its pity.  

---

## IX. The Ellipsis and the Unspeakable  

Ratcliffe ends with the typographical sign itself.  
From 1850 onward, critics note, the ellipsis — “…” — proliferates in fiction, marking what cannot or need not be said:contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}.  
In Joyce’s story, the dots between clauses are **counterparts** of each other: the bureaucratic omission and the emotional void.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Dots of Despair**  
> The ellipsis translates silence into print.  
> On paper, pain becomes punctuation — a minimal mark carrying maximal feeling.  
> To “join the dots,” Ratcliffe concludes, is to re-enter the affect beaten out of the mechanised page.  

---

## Conclusion: Paper Feelings  

The lecture closes on a paradox: paper, the flimsiest of substances, becomes the Victorians’ deepest metaphor.  
It signifies fragility, bureaucracy, disposability, yet also **continuity and care**.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Paper Soul**  
> “Paper sorrows,” Ratcliffe says, “are the sorrows we can still hold.”  
> To study Victorian literature through its paper is to trace how emotion endures through matter — how reading itself is the art of handling what was once thrown away.

## Motif Tracker  

| **Motif** | **Example(s)** | **Interpretive Use** |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Paper as Material and Metaphor** | Carlyle’s “Age of Paper”; Dickens’s *Pickwick Papers* | Symbol of modernity’s fragility: medium of thought and waste alike. |
| **“Paper Sorrows”** | Jane Frith Panton; Dickens’s sentimental fiction | Emotional life commodified; printed grief as both counterfeit and preservation. |
| **Curl-Papers and the Body** | *Pickwick Papers*, ch. 22 | Paper’s intimacy with flesh; the cerebral becomes comic materiality. |
| **Colour and Commerce** | Blue and yellow curl-papers; Dickens’s serial advertisements | Print culture mirrored in the domestic sphere; art turned commodity. |
| **Flatness and Feeling** | Critical charges against Dickens’s “flat” characters | Surface depth: emotion conveyed through repetition and texture, not introspection. |
| **Bureaucratic Paperwork** | Mr Snagsby’s inventories; Chancery in *Bleak House* | The paralysis of enumeration; lists as symbols of institutional stasis. |
| **Paper Consumption** | Melmotte’s tissue contracts; “eating” documents | Text literally embodied; guilt ingested; the collapse of medium into matter. |
| **Copying and Counterparts** | Dickens’s Nemo; Joyce’s Farrington | Repetition as dehumanisation; clerical routine erases identity. |
| **Ellipsis / Omission** | Joyce’s “…”; bureaucratic blanks | Punctuation as pathos; silence represented typographically. |
| **Modern Afterlife of Paper** | The paper clerk → modern bureaucracy | Transition from Victorian print to twentieth-century mechanisation; the persistence of paperwork as metaphor for alienation. |

---

## Critical Lenses  

| **Axis** | **Relationship** | **Implication** |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Material ↔ Emotional** | Paper as both object and metaphor | Emotions take physical form; sentimental value resides in matter. |
| **Body ↔ Text** | Curl-papers, handwriting, consumption | The human inscribed into paper; embodiment of reading and writing. |
| **Commodity ↔ Art** | Serial publication and advertising | Art entangled with commerce; aesthetics shaped by market circulation. |
| **Repetition ↔ Selfhood** | Copy clerks and bureaucracy | Repetition depletes individuality; modern alienation scripted through paperwork. |
| **Surface ↔ Depth** | “Flat” characters | Pathos of surface; interiority translated into visible gesture. |
| **Writing ↔ Violence** | Joyce’s “Counterparts” | The act of copying mirrored by acts of cruelty; textual and physical reproduction linked. |
| **Waste ↔ Preservation** | Recycled paper, serialized fiction | What is disposable becomes archival; fragility as endurance. |
| **Speech ↔ Silence** | Ellipsis and omission | Punctuation as emotional economy; printed gaps signify what society represses. |

## Exam Relevance  

### Core Relevance to Paper 3 (1830–1910)

- Illuminates the **material history of literature** — print, paper, and serial culture.  
- Offers insight into **Dickens’s realism and form**, focusing on how material “stuff” carries moral and emotional weight.  
- Bridges **Victorian to modernist transitions**, tracing bureaucracy and repetition from Dickens to Joyce.  
- Engages with the **ethics of attention to the ordinary**, a skill central to close reading.  

### Analytical Skills  

- Reading **objects as symbols** within literary description.  
- Connecting **material form** (paper, typography, serial format) to **thematic content** (emotion, bureaucracy).  
- Using **intertextual comparison**: Dickens → Braddon → Trollope → Joyce.  
- Recognising **periodical context** and visual culture as literary evidence.  

### Model Essay Patterns  

1. **“The Victorians lived and felt on paper.”** — Discuss using Dickens and *Bleak House*.  
2. **“Flatness is the form of feeling.”** — Analyse surface and sentiment in Dickens’s characters.  
3. **“The copy clerk is the first modern.”** — Compare the bureaucratic body from *Bleak House* to Joyce’s *Dubliners*.  
4. **“To read Dickens is to handle paper.”** — Explore the material imagination of Victorian fiction.  

### Revision Strategies  

- Review *Bleak House* passages describing Snagsby, Nemo, and Chancery’s documents.  
- Memorise key metaphors (curl-papers, ledgers, advertisements, ellipses).  
- Note links to **print technology and gender** — female labour and domestic paper culture.  
- Practise connecting **material form to emotional tone** — how paper mediates feeling.
