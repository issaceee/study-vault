# Cleaned Up Notes

## The Victorian Novel: Form, Experiment, and Story

### Core Idea
Victorian fiction marks a point where **the private pressures of a writer’s style meet the public expectations of established genres**.  
This “encounter” between the personal and the formal allows the Victorian novel to remain *novel* — a literary experiment in an era of convention and moral seriousness.

> **Mini-Essay — Fiction as Experiment**  
> The Victorian novel does not only tell stories but *thinks* through storytelling. It becomes a **laboratory for testing moral sympathy, perception, and aesthetic freedom** — an early form of literary self-consciousness that anticipates modernism. Writers such as Dickens, Eliot, and James turn narrative form itself into a philosophical question: *what can fiction know, and what does it risk by knowing it?*

---

### The Story of the Story
Henry James, in his *Preface to The Ambassadors* (1909), reflects that his “bag of adventures” as a writer is only half-emptied by telling the story itself; there is also “the story of one’s story.”  
This self-awareness introduces a major nineteenth-century concern: **fiction’s doubleness** — every novel carries the *story it tells* and the *story of its own making*.

#### Victorian Fiction as a Meeting Point
- Private artistic impulse vs. public form and readership  
- History of genre = history of **experiments in narrative voice and structure**  
- Fiction = negotiation between **truth-telling and artifice**, or between *realism* and *romance*

---

### From Romanticism to Modernism — A Bridge, Not a Break
The nineteenth-century novel is often misread teleologically — as a bridge between Romanticism’s sentiment and Modernism’s experiment.  
But Victorian writers didn’t see themselves as transitional. They saw themselves as **pioneers in a still-forming genre**, making the rules up as they went along.

- The “story” of Victorian fiction cannot be told as a straight romance from Scott → Dickens → Eliot → James → Conrad → Joyce.  
- Each writer confronts new tensions between moral order, social reality, and artistic form.  
- Fiction’s evolution is messy, dialogic, recursive.

> **Mini-Essay — Against the Smooth Narrative of Progress**  
> To treat Victorian fiction as a stepping stone to Modernism risks overlooking its radical presentness. Each novel, from *Middlemarch* to *Bleak House*, invents its own grammar of sympathy, its own system of seeing. Rather than a bridge, the Victorian novel is a **kaleidoscope of experiments**, where literature learns to see itself seeing.

---

### Fiction’s Questions: Realism, Romance, and the Art of Fiction
Victorian criticism buzzed with unresolved questions:
- What’s the right balance between *realism* and *romance*?  
- Should fiction depict life as it *is* or as it *might be*?  
- Does art cultivate sympathy or selfishness? (*Middlemarch*: empathy vs. private indulgence)  
- Should the novel obey aesthetic rules or represent social truth?

#### The Novel as a Site of Debate
Victorian fiction doesn’t just provoke these questions — it **includes** them.  
The debates on art, sympathy, and reality unfold *within* the novels themselves, turning them into sites of meta-literary reflection.

#### “On Art in Fiction” → “The Art of Fiction”
The shift from Edward Bulwer Lytton’s *On Art in Fiction* (1838) to Henry James’s *The Art of Fiction* (1884) marks a critical evolution:
- “In fiction” → art as an ingredient of storytelling  
- “Of fiction” → art as the essence of storytelling  

> **Mini-Essay — The Novel Becomes Self-Conscious**  
> By the end of the century, fiction had turned its gaze inward. The novel becomes not just a medium that *contains* art but one that *is* art.  
> Henry James’s change of preposition encapsulates this transformation: fiction evolves from being a vessel for moral messages to a deliberate construction of perception — a way of *seeing through artifice to truth*.


## Reading, Suspicion, and the Self-Conscious Story

### Affection or Infection? — Reading as Moral Crisis
In *Great Expectations* (1860–61), Pip’s letter to Joe — *“MI DEER JO i OPE U R KR WITE WELL…”* — ends with the cryptic “INF XN.”  
This phrase can be read as both **“infection”** and **“in fiction”** — a pun encapsulating the moral ambivalence of Victorian reading.  

Pip’s narrative splits between:
- **Young Pip** — naïve, romantic, longing for elevation.  
- **Old Pip** — reflective, chastened, aware of moral contamination.

This double-voiced narrative mirrors the Victorian anxiety that **imagination might corrupt as much as it enlightens**.  
Reading was described as both a moral education and a potential sickness. Critics worried that the novel — especially romance — excited the imagination to dangerous degrees, particularly in women readers.

George Eliot, in *The Natural History of German Life* (1856), defends art as *“the nearest thing to life,”* a way of *“extending our contact with our fellow-men beyond the bounds of our personal lot.”*  
Yet other commentators (1853–59) warned that novel-reading could cause *“ill health, insanity, and even death.”*  

> **Mini-Essay — Fiction as Contagion**  
> The nineteenth-century novel constantly negotiates this tension: *is fiction a cure or a disease?*  
> Its power to create sympathy is inseparable from its power to distort reality. Pip’s infection is also his initiation — reading, like storytelling, is the price of self-knowledge. The Victorian novel thus dramatizes a **psychological epidemiology**, where every act of imagination risks contamination.

---

### Treating Fiction with Suspicion
Victorian writers repeatedly ask: *what is a story for?*  
Their novels often contain **fictional writers and readers**, dramatizing anxieties about storytelling itself.

- **Scenes of Writing:** the *Künstlerroman* (artist’s novel) such as Dickens’s *David Copperfield* (1850) or Gissing’s *New Grub Street* (1891) explores authorship as labour and self-exposure.  
- **Thomas Miller’s *Godfrey Malvern* (1842)** — an early example of a novelist learning his trade amidst failure and wastepaper.  
- **Scenes of Reading:** more common than writing — characters model good and bad reading habits.

### Reading as Mirror: Art and Everyday Life
Victorian painting and fiction both fixate on the act of reading:
- *Alice in Wonderland* (George Dunlop Leslie, 1879): reading as entry into imagination — a gateway to “Wonderland.”  
- *The Travelling Companions* (Augustus Egg, 1862): two women, one reading, one dreaming, both ignoring the external world.  
- *Through the Looking Glass* (John Tenniel, 1872): visually echoes Egg’s composition, suggesting an artistic in-joke — **reading and dreaming as twin forms of escape.**

> **Mini-Essay — Reading as Self-Portrait**  
> Victorian novels mirror their own readers. Scenes of reading dramatize **the ethics of interpretation** — the tension between attention and fantasy.  
> The figure of the absorbed reader is both ideal and warning: she embodies fiction’s power to create inner worlds that rival the external one.  
> To read too well is to disappear. The Victorian reader’s rapture becomes the novelist’s self-questioning.

---

### Style as Thought: Kingsley’s Syntax
Charles Kingsley’s *Alton Locke* (1850) reveals how **form and syntax carry ideological meaning.**  
He writes:  
> “See what a chaos of noble materials is here — all confused, it is true — polarised, jarring, and chaotic… but only waiting for the one inspiring Spirit to organise and unite and consecrate this chaos into the noblest polity the world ever saw realised!”

The sentence seems on the verge of collapse — dashes fracture it — but those same breaks also **bridge** ideas together.

- Kingsley’s form *enacts* the moral labour of coherence: writing itself becomes an act of redemption.  
- The last word, “realised,” resolves not only the sentence but the anxiety of meaning itself.

> **Mini-Essay — Syntax as Theology**  
> Kingsley’s dashes become both fractures and ligatures — typographical metaphors for faith in connection.  
> His prose performs the drama of thought struggling into order. Victorian style, in this sense, **thinks on the page** — syntax as a spiritual and intellectual choreography.

---
### From the General to the Particular — Victorian Fiction as Cultural Discourse
The development of Victorian fiction is not a simple, teleological movement (Dickens → Eliot → James → Conrad).  
Instead, it unfolds as a **constellation of experiments** — each testing how language might reconcile individual perception and collective truth.

To read Victorian fiction is to enter a **cultural discourse** that includes:
- Authors, critics, publishers, readers, and reviewers — all writing in the same language of morality and art.  
- Fiction and criticism overlap: the novelist often *is* a critic, analysing the very form they employ.  
- As Henry James later put it, the novel becomes a “house of fiction” with *a million windows*, each reflecting a distinct moral and aesthetic vision.

> **Mini-Essay — The Novel as Cultural Medium**  
> The Victorian novel is not only literature; it is **a mode of cultural thinking**. It negotiates social anxieties through narrative experiment, drawing the entire literary marketplace — writer, publisher, reader — into one ongoing conversation about truth, sympathy, and art.

## The House, the Home, and the Uncanny

### The “House of Fiction”
Henry James’s *Preface to The Portrait of a Lady* (1908) famously describes fiction as a **house with “not one window, but a million.”**  
Each window represents an individual writer’s vision — shaped by *“the need of the individual vision and by the pressure of the individual will.”*  

This metaphor makes fiction architectural:
- The **story** becomes a *structure of perception*, built out of choices of perspective and framing.
- The **reader** becomes a visitor moving through these rooms, peering from different angles.  

Each writer constructs their own dwelling — their own moral architecture of seeing.

> **Mini-Essay — Architecture of Vision**  
> The “house of fiction” is an image of both unity and difference: the building stands as one, yet its windows never align.  
> James uses this image to describe **the ethics of perception** — that every story is partial, situated, and willed.  
> In a period obsessed with domestic order, he makes the house a metaphor for the *interiorisation of truth*: vision as habitation.

---

### The Haunted House: Fiction and the Gothic Inheritance
James reworks this metaphor in *The Turn of the Screw* (1898):  
the governess enters a “big, ugly, antique, but convenient house” that embodies layers of history — *“half replaced and half utilised.”*

- The Gothic mansion becomes a **palimpsest** — a modern structure haunted by older forms.  
- This doubling mirrors Victorian fiction itself: realist surfaces animated by Gothic undercurrents.  
- The modern novel acknowledges its ancestry — even when pretending to exorcise it.

> **Mini-Essay — The Ghost of Genre**  
> In James’s fiction, the haunted house stands for the genre’s own hauntedness.  
> Realism never escapes romance; every claim to modernity echoes older mythic forms.  
> The uncanny, then, is not an intrusion from outside but a **return of the literary repressed** — the persistence of the past within the form of progress.

---

### Home as Ideology
The nineteenth-century *home* is not just a physical space but a **repository of values**: security, domestic virtue, affection, privacy.  
Poems like Felicia Hemans’s *“The Homes of England”* and songs such as *“Home Sweet Home”* celebrate the house as a moral and emotional sanctuary.  

For novelists such as Dickens, the home becomes both **the narrative goal and the ideological problem**:
- *Oliver Twist* ends with the hero safely “at home” with Mr. Brownlow.  
- *David Copperfield* resolves in domestic harmony with Agnes.  
- Yet these endings come only after profound instability — or literal homelessness.  

A happy home marks the *end of story*; narrative energy depends on the **threat of dislocation.**

> **Mini-Essay — The Paradox of Home**  
> Victorian fiction both idealises and destabilises the domestic sphere.  
> To reach the home is to reach stasis — which means that the novel must imperil it to stay alive.  
> Home is fiction’s promised rest and its narrative extinction. The reader’s pleasure depends on peril, on the tension between belonging and exile.

---

### The Uncanny: Familiar Things Made Strange
Freud’s concept of *das Unheimliche* (“the unhomely”) perfectly describes this tension.  
Victorian fiction, for all its moral closure, often **renders the familiar strange**.  

Dickens, in his preface to *Bleak House* (1853), writes that he has *“purposely dwelt upon the romantic side of familiar things.”*  
His description of London’s “soft black drizzle,” the “crust upon crust of mud,” and the linguistic degradation of *“Mallard”* for “My Lord” all serve to estrange the everyday.

- The *romantic side of familiar things* is the moment of **defamiliarisation** — the shock of perception that renews vision.  
- Art reveals that the ordinary world has always been uncanny, once we look closely enough.

> **Mini-Essay — Realism as Estrangement**  
> Dickens’s realism is not plain mimesis but **a poetics of re-enchantment**.  
> The familiar is rendered strange so that readers may see it anew — a process of moral awakening through aesthetic surprise.  
> The uncanny becomes not an exception but the method of realism itself: *to refresh our perception by unsettling what we think we know.*

---

### The Reader’s Labour: Connection and Contingency
In *Bleak House*, Dickens famously asks:  
> “What connexion can there be between the place in Lincolnshire, the house in town… and Jo the outlaw with the broom?”  

The reader must weave together these fragments into coherence.  
The novel’s serial form makes that task literal: Dickens was only ever *a month ahead* of his readers.  
Victorian fiction thus becomes a **collaboration between author and audience**, balancing design and contingency.

- Readers experience long anticipation punctuated by brief updates — *temporal realism*.  
- Meaning emerges retrospectively: *the reader must connect the parts into a whole.*

Peter Conrad calls Victorian literature a *“treasure-house of detail but an indifferent whole.”*  
This makes reading an act of design — the reader performs the very unity the novel pretends to possess.

> **Mini-Essay — The Reader as Architect**  
> In serialized fiction, design becomes distributed.  
> The author builds in fragments; the reader constructs the edifice.  
> Victorian fiction trains its audience in interpretation — a moral exercise in patience, connection, and imaginative coherence.  
> Reading is thus **both aesthetic and ethical work**, teaching the art of making meaning across time.

## Fiction as Labour, Parody, and Critical Reflection

### The Marketplace of Fiction
Victorian writers worked in a **lively literary marketplace** — the era’s equivalent of modern mass media.  
Anthony Trollope, in his *Autobiography* (1883), describes writing by the watch: *“250 words every quarter of an hour.”*  
This industrialised rhythm of creativity reveals a paradox:
- Fiction was a **vocation and a profession**.  
- Literature was both art and labour — moral and commercial enterprise.

The “English common reader,” as Virginia Woolf later calls them, became a powerful economic and imaginative force.  
Novelists had to compete for attention, working within a **literary democracy** where women, journalists, and sensationalists shared the same pages.

> **Mini-Essay — Writing as Work**  
> The Victorian writer straddles art and industry. Trollope’s precision exemplifies how fiction becomes both mechanical and miraculous:  
> *mechanical* in its production, *miraculous* in its power to produce sympathy.  
> The writer’s professionalism does not diminish the art; it **grounds it in the ethics of craft** — the belief that disciplined labour could yield emotional truth.

---

### Parody and Proliferation
With so many writers competing for the same audience, the Victorian age became one of **parody and self-parody**.  
Caricature, burlesque, and literary pastiche flourished — the inevitable result of overproduction.  
The novel learned to **laugh at itself**.

This self-mockery was also self-preservation: parody became a critical tool, a way of asserting individuality in a crowded field.  
It helped fiction to evolve by **testing its own limits**, exposing clichés before they hardened.

> **Mini-Essay — Irony as Renewal**  
> Parody in the Victorian period is not trivial mockery but a form of critical renewal.  
> By imitating itself, the novel protects its vitality — burning away convention through laughter.  
> Irony, then, is realism’s immune system: the body of fiction inoculates itself against its own excesses.

---

### The Overflow of Life: Fiction’s Incompletion
Henry James writes in the *Preface to Roderick Hudson* (1907) that *“relations stop nowhere.”*  
The artist’s challenge is to “draw the circle within which they shall appear to do so.”  
This becomes the final paradox of Victorian form:
- Life exceeds form, yet art must **feign containment**.  
- Fiction is an act of *temporary order* imposed on infinite relations.

Victorian fiction continually acknowledges the **overflow of life beyond narrative’s borders** — the sense that story cannot end neatly without falsification.

> **Mini-Essay — The Ethics of Incompletion**  
> James’s “geometry of relations” defines the late Victorian imagination: art as an effort to **trace limits within the limitless**.  
> The form’s honesty lies in its awareness of artifice.  
> Every ending gestures toward what exceeds it — a humility before reality that becomes the moral ground of realism itself.

## Motif Tracker — Recurring Images and Metaphors

| **Motif** | **Example(s)** | **Interpretive Use** |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **House / Home** | Henry James’s “house of fiction”; Dickens’s domestic tableaux | Fiction as moral and perceptual architecture; domesticity as both goal and threat |
| **Fabric / Textile** | Bakhtin’s “Discourse in the Novel” — the text as woven speech | The novel as a hybrid form interlacing many discourses (dialogism) |
| **Infection / Affection** | *Great Expectations*, Eliot’s essays | Fiction as contagion and cure; empathy as both moral virtue and danger |
| **Chaos and Syntax** | Kingsley’s dashes; Alton Locke | Style as moral labour — syntax turning chaos into coherence |
| **Reading / Dreaming** | Egg’s *Travelling Companions*, Leslie’s *Alice in Wonderland* | Reading as creation of private worlds; fiction as mirror of the reader’s mind |
| **Ghost / Uncanny** | *The Turn of the Screw*, *Bleak House* | Realism haunted by romance; the familiar made strange |
| **Labour / Profession** | Trollope, the literary market | Fiction as disciplined craft; art as vocation within capitalism |

---

## Critical Lenses — Analytical Frameworks for Victorian Fiction

| **Relationship** | **Guiding Question** | **Critical Aim** |
|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Text ↔ Context** | Does the novel reflect its historical moment or resist it? | Identify social critique vs. complicity |
| **Parts ↔ Whole** | How do small moments (syntax, metaphor) scale to large themes? | Link micro-style to macro-form |
| **Writer ↔ Style** | How does individual style express moral or aesthetic vision? | Distinguish voice amid shared conventions |
| **Story ↔ Convention** | Does the text renovate or reproduce genre norms? | Measure innovation within continuity |
| **Reader ↔ Text** | How is sympathy produced, limited, or tested? | Explore ethics of reading and affect |

## Exam Relevance — Applying to Oxford Prelims (Paper 3)

### Core Skills and Focus Areas
- **Close Reading:** Be ready to analyse *style as argument* — syntax, metaphor, and voice as moral forms.  
- **Historical Awareness:** Situate novels within debates about realism, morality, and art (e.g. Lytton vs. James).  
- **Comparative Thinking:** Draw links between texts, genres, and critical discourses.  
- **Critical Self-Consciousness:** Recognise how fiction comments on its own form — novels as theory in narrative disguise.

### Essay Patterns to Practise
1. **Form and Ethics** — e.g. “In what ways does realism involve a moral choice of style?”  
   - Compare *Middlemarch* and *Bleak House*: sympathy vs. observation.  
2. **The Novel and Self-Consciousness** — e.g. “How do Victorian novels reflect on their own storytelling?”  
   - Use *Great Expectations* and *The Ambassadors*.  
3. **Home and the Uncanny** — e.g. “Why does the domestic ideal generate unease?”  
   - Contrast Dickens’s endings with James’s haunted interiors.  
4. **Art and Labour** — e.g. “Is professional authorship compatible with artistic freedom?”  
   - Draw on Trollope and the *Künstlerroman* tradition.

### Key Revision Strategies
- Pair **one major realist** (Eliot, Dickens) with **one late stylist** (James, Conrad) to trace the evolution of self-conscious form.  
- Annotate **passages where narrative voice fractures** — the double consciousness of narrator and character.  
- Practise **mini-close readings** of metaphors of houses, illness, or machinery — these motifs condense Victorian aesthetics.  
- Remember the *dialogic* nature of the period: fiction, criticism, and readership form one conversation.

> **Final Reflection — The Victorian Novel as Thinking Form**  
> The nineteenth-century novel does not merely depict society; it interrogates the act of depiction itself.  
> It balances moral sincerity with formal innovation, empathy with irony.  
> Victorian fiction stands at the moment where **art becomes aware of its own thinking**, transforming narrative into a mode of philosophy.

# Own Notes


1. Henry James
	- history of genre, history of experiments in 

victorian novel
- encounter between the private pressures of the writer's style and the public pressure between established forms and styles
- allows the novel to celebrate literary innovation - to be *novel*

devt of victorian fiction
- is there a story/plot? who are the heroes/heroine
- while it might be tempting to read it at first as a romance, ----- to become sophisticated (james/conrad) --> victorian literature is a bridge between romanticism and modernism, an awkard phase needed to get thorugh in order to produce masterpieces like ulysses


- victorian novelists saw themselves as pioneers, novels were thought experiments, absolute truths became relative ones, where there can be so many perspectives that one can take, so many private worlds that can be hidden inside our shared world
- how fiction should work vs how it did work
	- what is the right balance btw realism and romance?
	- should a novel depict the world as it was or as it might be?
	- did Middlemarch encourage sympath or did it encourage selfishness (by ignoring demands of real people)
	- should a novel be a work of art that plays to its own rules? or as a window to real life
victorian novels not only provoked these questions, but included them

1. On Art In Fiction
2. Henry James The Art of Fiction
	- "in" to "of"
		- fiction no longer includes elements of art, but IS art

3. GreaT Expectations Source
	1. 2 sides of PIP - the sad wiser voice of Old Pip who knows that as the adopted son vs. the younger unwise Pip


Victorian Literature
- common symbolism: Affection Or Infection? (See George Elliot Source 4) --> "INF XN" (Great Expectation)
	- "The craving for books may not be a disease"
	- "the secret court of much ill health in sanity and even death"

OR "In Fiction"
- Pip who tells a story of phony/fakeness of London --> 


Treating Fiction with an element of Suspicion
- What is a story for?
- a common question/criticism that victorian writers often question
	- look into genre's taht look at fictional novelists (kunstleroman)
		- Godfrey Malvern, Thomas Miller
- But more common than scenes of writing is scenes of reading -> Alice in WOoderland (George Dunlop Leslie, painting, 1879)
	- characters are offered as models of how to read/warnings of how easy it is to misread
	- AUgustus Egg, The Travelling COmpanions (1862)
		- reading vs dreaming, both seem happy to ignore the landscae, both prefer the kind of world that you can create themself
			- historical context: railway, emergence of paperback novels as a travelling companion
	- John Tenniel...... (1872)
		- same style of composition and hat as prev painting, on purpose? or to subvert



Victorian Literature and Style contains subtle clues on how to approach it:
- See Source 6 Kingsley
	- dashes threaten the sentence with fracture but transforms themselves into bridges as he searches for connection
	- he shows how writing can break down easily when writing tries to make sense of the real world but the solution is in his last word



1. Development is far more complicated than a tellulogical devt (Dickens to Conrad)
2. IF we want to avoid clumsy one size fits all novel liek the gothic novel, we might want to look at Victorian Literature through smaller keyhols like Kingsley sprawling syntax, little moments that start from a smaller textual detail that widen up into critical themes
	1. Victorian literature and literary critic often overlap -> critics use the same medium as their subject! 
	2. Often Fiction writer and critic were the same person, when we refer to Victorian Fiction, were not only talking abt a particular kind of writing but also talking about a **cultural discourse** a whole netowkr of assumptions - from the writers study to the readers armchair, including publishers
		- Thus includes the clultural narratives underppinning the books, the stories that victorian writers were telling stories abt themselves and the world theyre inhabiting

TIP
- Investigate moments where victorian writers are drawing on *same language*
	- See SOurce 7 -> Henry James using metaphor of a house to describe stories
		- even if 2 people write about the same subject, they never have exactly the same outlook, thus the stories wont look exactly the same
	- See Source 8 --> Henry James exploring the metaphor of a house in his own fiction
		- works like a literary wink of old victorian ghost story hosues --> a literary wink, even though we are reading a modenr novel it has its roots in old gothic novels - a literary extension
	- another metpahor of a house as a **home** (Source 9)
		- victorian - home was not jsut a physcial place, but a repositry of values (love, security), home was where the heart was AND closely associated with readings
		- the home is where many plots finish (Dickens often concludes his stories with a tableu of a family safely settled in)
		- if a happy home is where a novel is ending, it is also where the story must cease (the novel must put everything it represents at risk before they can relax if not the story will be super boring) --> a lot of victorian fiction follows this pattern of discouraging the readers from feeling too much at home

See Source 10
- victorian fiction draws us on a promise to resolution but in the meantime it disturbs and misorientats us, it adopts familar techniques but makes them strange, it is *uncanny*
- See source 11
	- he wanted to describe everyday lives in a way that would refresh our perceptions about bits of the world we wld usually take for granted
	- descriptions give us a feeling of surprise and inevitability --> as we are looking something at an unexpected angle and realising that it is only strange because we havent looked at it that way before
		- something that forces us to realise just how much remains invisible to us

Read Source 12
- written by a fugitive american slave
- extraordinary act of literary ventriloquism - often reworks of passages of *bleak house*
- works within an established literary canon to establish a voice for herself

Suggests that victorian ficiton -> despite the rise of realism, the best writters didnt just reflect the wolrd, but used language in a way that allowed them to REMAKE this world



- 'text' has the same root as 'textile', think of the novel as a fabric, a design woven from many different styles of speech/literary threads (theatrical dialogue, profession vocab, street slang etc.) --> victorian novels are HYBRID forms ==> read the essay "Discourse in the Novel"

- increasing sophisticated interplay btw psychology and the literary voice
	- novels tell us what people think they are doing -> techniques liek Free Indirect Discourse to allow reader to imagine what its liek to be someone else WHILE keeping a critical distance between them, balancing sympathy against scrutiny
	- "an opportunity to rehearse our sympathy for other people while testing its limits"

See SOurce 13
- its the reader who has to work out how each part of bleak hosue has to connect to each other part (characters etc.)


- the serial nature means that the author is only ever only 1 month ahead of his readers, novels is a triumph reconciliation of design and contingency
	- What does it mean for readers?
		- reading experience is made up of long periods of anticipation against quick literary updates
		- novels ask the reader to work out how the parts combine into a whole (read Peter Conrad, the Victorain Treasurehouse -- victorian literature as "a treasurehouse of detail but an indifferent whole"?)

other than novels, readers were reading the victorian equivalent of Jk Rowland
*the english common reader*
- writers were aware of what they had to achieve to compete in such a competitive literary marketplace (see Source 14) -- > not unusual in seeing writing as a job/vocation
- fiction is a literary democrary where riches can be made, where famous authors could be celebrities and where women could be on equal standard as men
-

victorian ages were one of the greatest periods of parody
- w/ so many writers fighting for attention, it allowed writers to fight off the competition

==> where do we start? stop? how do we take anything abt this big and messy world without drifting into commonplaces and cliches?
- See Source 15
	- life will always spill over the artificial borders that fiction imposes on it


STRATEGIES Guidelines
- relationships, at its heart a good deal of victorian fiction sets out to understand human relationships (friendship, marriage, past & present)
- tackle it through critical relationships
	- text & context
		- does it merely reflect context or press back against
	- parts & whole
		- how do the parts assemble into patterns? how should we read those patterns?
	- writers idea and their style
		- what distinguishes the writer from the other styles of the time? how does the writer's style inform his own text
	- this story and earlier stories?
		- does it settle itself into a sect of conventions, renovate those conventions or strike of in a different direction entirely.
- if still cant see it through these lenses, enjoy the text for its resistance to criticism
