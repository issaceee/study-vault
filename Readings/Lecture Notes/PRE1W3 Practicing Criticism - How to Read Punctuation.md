# Cleaned Up Notes

# Own Notes

* Print seperates a voice from its body
	* punctuation helps to restore what the printed page removes

- 2 ways to think about punct
	- syntactic - divides up a piece of writing into grammatical units that help to make sense of the scatter and drift of words on the page
	- elocutionary(?) - shows us where to pause, in order to reporoduce the sounds of the author's voice, pacing, emphasis etc. --> see source 2
		- face 3 problems
			- a lot can happen between the act of writing and a piece of published writing
			- different writiers have diff expectations when it comes to punctuating their work
				- mark twain was vv precise
				- but wordsworth was vv happy for other people to correct his punctuation
			- punctuation is often ambiguous
				- fullstop and comma, directed primarly towards the ear
				- bracket is directed primarly towards the eye
				- some depends on creative tension between eye and ear - line endings in verse (repeatedly asking us whether the end of line is the end of thought)

- speech vs print
	- punctuation is often bound to much larger ideological questions of what we can or cannot say
		- Who is writing for?
	- earliest punctuation is the paragraph
	
- individual patterns of speech vs shared rules of grammar
	- punctuation reveals tension btw the individual and a group
		- the writers voice vs the sared conventions of print
	- punctuation can reflect social rules and an individuals thought

- punctuation is a good way to assess the rewards adn risks of conencting ideas/people to each other
- punctuation has no intrinsic semantic valuem it only connects

Dashes: 
- Laurence Sterne
	- unique way to reproduce the narrators voice as he changes his mind, delay revelations etc.
- Emily Dickinson's poem
	- suggests distant horizons
	- type of friendship
	- lifelines
		- more symbolic
- ==> indicates how tightly a writing sticks tgt/cracks of logic/writing

* *to see how a pucntuation works, try to replace it with a conjunction

- punctuation as an indication of tone and sense
