## Introduction: “It Was the Best of Times, It Was the Worst of Times”

Victorian poetry is a literature of **paradox and plurality** — an art of *many voices*. Dickens’s famous opening to *A Tale of Two Cities* (1859) captures the spirit of the age: “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times… we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way”:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  
This doubleness — the simultaneous pull of belief and doubt, progress and nostalgia — shapes the entire poetic landscape of the nineteenth century.

As *Tennyson’s Ulysses* puts it, the modern world “moans round with many voices” (1842). Victorian poems, like that sea, contain discordant tones: lyric and epic, private and public, faith and scepticism. Their “dialogue of the mind with itself” (Arnold 1853) becomes, as Isobel Armstrong writes, *“the dialogue of the poem with itself”* — the poem’s self-questioning, its capacity to hold contradictory truths at once:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

> **Mini-Essay — The Age of Twinning**  
> The Victorians inherited Romantic subjectivity but lived in a mechanised world. Their poems respond to this dissonance by doubling and dividing the self — *Jekyll and Hyde*, *Dorian Gray and his portrait*, *North and South*. The result is a poetics of multiplicity: an art that is always talking to itself.

## The Victorian Dialogue: Poetry as Self-Confrontation

Victorian poems are **dialogic**, often structured as debates or dramatic monologues that question their own authority. They emerged during a time when poetry’s social role was itself in crisis: was it central or peripheral, prophetic or ornamental?  

Arnold’s preface to *Poems* (1853) announces the shift from “the calm, the cheerfulness, the disinterested objectivity” of ancient art to “the dialogue of the mind with itself” (Arnold 1853). Public rhetoric gives way to private introspection, yet the best poets turn this introspection outward — transforming the self’s divisions into forms of collective address:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

> **Mini-Essay — “To Speak with Several Voices at Once”**  
> T. S. Eliot later wrote that one must live “on several planes at once,” though “one cannot speak with several voices at once” (*The Family Reunion*, 1939). Victorian poets try anyway. They write in polyphony — their uncertainty becomes their subject, their fractured voice their form.

---

## Tennyson and the “Antiphonal Voice of the Heckler”

Tennyson exemplifies this doubleness: the public poet laureate whose verse harbours private doubt. *“The Charge of the Light Brigade”* (1854) is a case study in conflicted tone.

> *“Half a league, half a league,  
> Half a league onward,  
> All in the valley of Death  
> Rode the six hundred.”*

Read superficially, the poem appears to glorify military duty. Yet its rhythm and diction undermine that very heroism. “Their’s but to do and die” flattens the martial slogan “do or die” into fatalistic inevitability. The pause in “Some one had blunder’d” isolates guilt; “half a league” repeats until it sounds like compulsion rather than courage. Even the dactylic metre — the gallop of hooves — wavers between drive and dread:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

Published in *The Examiner* (Dec. 1854), the poem appeared beside reports on the Crimean War and on the Peace Society — a “chorus of paratexts” that refracted its message. The newspaper itself became a polyphonic anthology, each article echoing or undermining Tennyson’s heroic rhythm.

> **Mini-Essay — The Poet as Rebel-Conformist**  
> T. S. Eliot called Tennyson “the most instinctive rebel against the society in which he was the most perfect conformist.” Each Tennysonian lyric is two poems in one: the laureate’s patriotic voice intertwined with the antiphonal voice of doubt — what Geoffrey Hill termed *“the antiphonal voice of the heckler.”* The poem’s true subject is its own inner argument.

---

## Form as Resistance: Tradition and Innovation

Victorian poetry thrives where **form encounters friction** — where inherited structures warp under modern strain. As Armstrong notes, poems like *The Two Voices* or *Maud* contain “footnotes quietly incorporated into the main text”: self-commentary disguised as song:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.

George Meredith’s *Modern Love* (1862) stretches the sonnet sequence into 16-line “broken” sonnets chronicling marital collapse — rhyme and rhythm dislocating like the lovers’ hearts. Similarly, in Tennyson’s *Supposed Confessions of a Second-Rate Sensitive Mind*, uneven lineation mirrors psychic instability:  
> “Men pass me by; / Christians with happy countenances…”  
The disintegration of metre signals both moral and social alienation.

> **Mini-Essay — The Strain of the Line**  
> The Victorians inherit strict forms — sonnets, blank verse, elegy — yet each poet writes as though testing their tensile strength. When metre falters, it is not failure but revelation: the voice straining against constraint, the old shell cracking to let new feeling through.

## Poetry in an Unpoetical Age

Matthew Arnold lamented in 1849 that “the age and all one’s surroundings are unpoetical” — not “unprofound” or “ungrand,” but hostile to poetry’s very condition (Arnold, letter to A. H. Clough). Industrial England, he feared, left little room for lyric thought. Dickens captures this tension in *Dombey and Son* (1848): Mrs. Skewton’s nostalgic cry for “the poetry of existence in these terrible days” becomes self-parody, the Victorians’ yearning for beauty commodified into cliché:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.

Art was seen as relic or luxury. The Welsh legend of *The Bard*, painted by John Martin (1817), dramatises the gap between poet and audience — the solitary figure on the cliff, singing above the noise of empire. Wordsworth’s lament, “Whither is fled the visionary gleam?” (1807), still reverberated; by the time Arnold wrote *Stanzas from the Grande Chartreuse*, the poet was “wandering between two worlds, one dead, the other powerless to be born.”

> **Mini-Essay — The Last Bards**  
> For Arnold, poetry became a “stay” — a support against chaos — but also a sign of loss. The poet in an “unpoetical age” is both prophet and fossil, trying to steady a civilisation that no longer listens.

## Competing with the Novel

By the 1850s, poetry’s rival was not philosophy but prose. The realist novel, with its social reach and moral clarity, seemed better suited to modern life. Victorian poets responded in two ways:

### 1. Retreat and Nostalgia  
Some, like Austin Dobson, turned backward. His “The Ballad of Prose and Rhyme” (1878) rejects prose’s weight for “the ripple of laughing rhyme.” Published beside Hardy’s *Return of the Native*, Dobson’s ballad reads as pastoral escapism — “hey for the ripple of rhyme!” — a retreat into artifice and Arcadia.

### 2. Adaptation and Expansion  
Others, like Elizabeth Barrett Browning, absorbed prose’s scope. *Aurora Leigh* (1856), her *Künstlerroman* in blank verse, fuses narrative realism with lyric introspection. Its rhythm swells and falters as Aurora tries to contain the “teeming life” of her “living, throbbing age” within verse:  
> “Their sole work is to represent the age,  
> Their age, not Charlemagne’s — this living, throbbing age…”  
The extra syllable in “throbbing age” enacts the overflow of content beyond form — poetry straining to accommodate modernity:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.

> **Mini-Essay — Verse Emerging from Prose**  
> Victorian poetry did not die under prose; it reabsorbed it. Browning, Tennyson, and Barrett Browning make verse porous — letting in journalism, science, gossip, the noise of cities. Poetry’s “many voices” thus mirror the age’s new forms of communication: the telegraph, the novel, the crowd.

---

## Progress and Its Discontents

Tennyson’s *Locksley Hall* (1842) cries, “Forward, forward let us range, / Let the great world spin for ever down the ringing grooves of change.” Yet the repetition of *forward* stumbles, as though progress catches in its own machinery. His metaphor of railway “grooves” suggests motion without direction — the wheel that “moves onward” yet “returns on itself.”  

Eliot later quipped: “Tennyson believed explicitly in progress, and believed implicitly that progress consists in things remaining much as they are” (Eliot, *In Memoriam* essay, 1936):contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}.  

Victorian “progress” is rhythmic, not linear — each revolution a rhyme with the past.

> **Mini-Essay — The Circular Groove of Change**  
> Victorian modernity is haunted by recurrence. For every “groove of change,” there is the counter-rhythm of nostalgia. Poetry becomes the space where progress and memory coexist — a wheel forever turning on itself.

---

## Repetition and Silence: The Limits of Speech

Victorian lyric often finds meaning in **repetition** — not monotony, but endurance.  
James Henry’s “Another and another and another” captures the weary rhythm of endless days: “The same yet different, different yet the same.” Rossetti’s “Snow had fallen, snow on snow” (*In the Bleak Midwinter*) transforms monotony into miracle: language as snowfall, each flake the same yet singular. Both fulfil Arnold’s hope that poetry might serve as a “stay” for culture — “its consolation in this present hurrying age” (*The Study of Poetry*, 1880).

Yet repetition also threatens to collapse into **silence**. Tennyson’s “Break, break, break” (1842) risks the disappearance of meaning: “I would that my tongue could utter / The thoughts that arise in me.” The triple stress of *Break, break, break* teeters between speech and stammer — the edge where poetry dissolves into inarticulate grief.

Adrienne Rich later wrote that “every poem breaks a silence that had to be overcome” (*What Is Found There*, 2003). For Tennyson, the fear is the inverse: that every poem may return to the silence it defies.

> **Mini-Essay — The Voice that Falters**  
> The Victorians wrote as if haunted by the possibility of their own obsolescence. Their most beautiful lines tremble on the brink of breakdown — as if lyric speech itself were a vanishing art.

---

## Conclusion: The Dark Reverse of the Tapestry

In an early play, *The Devil and the Lady* (c.1823), Tennyson describes the unseen side of embroidery: “the dark reverse of it, / The intertwining and rough wanderings of random threads.” That is Victorian poetry’s truest image: a surface of order concealing intricate knots beneath:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}.  

Its apparent certainties — faith, empire, propriety — hide countercurrents of doubt, rebellion, and irony. The Victorians may have believed in “the best of times,” but they also heard, beneath that harmony, the many discordant voices of their own making.

> **Mini-Essay — The Fire in the Thread**  
> Hopkins’s “fresh-firecoal chestnut-falls” (*Pied Beauty*, 1877) offers the final emblem: the husk split open to reveal “things counter, original, spare, strange.” Victorian poetry, too, cracks its own shell — releasing from within the spark of modernity.

## Motif Tracker

| **Motif** | **Example(s)** | **Interpretive Use** |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Dialogue / Polyphony** | Tennyson, Browning, Barrett Browning | Poems as self-debate; multiplicity of voices. |
| **Form vs. Feeling** | *Modern Love*, *Maud* | Innovation within constraint; metre as resistance. |
| **Progress / Stasis** | *Locksley Hall*; Eliot on Tennyson | Circular progress; the groove of change. |
| **Speech / Silence** | “Break, break, break”; Rossetti | Poetry between articulation and muteness. |
| **Poet / Society** | Arnold, Dickens, Martin’s *The Bard* | The poet’s isolation in an industrial age. |
| **Verse / Prose** | *Aurora Leigh*, Dobson | Negotiation with the novel; prose invading poetry. |

# Own Notes

- victorian love of paradox & opposition, time of splitting, twinning mirroring
	- self-confrontation can be seen at any level of victorian poetry
	- Vt poems are dialogic
	- did they connect people? or preserve distinctions?

"dialogue of the mind with itself" (source 5)
- public rhetoric has given way to private rueming?
- self-provision and self-multiplication is one of victorian poetry strenghts
	- who are they speaking to? who is listening?
	- ==the dialogue of a poem with itself (isabelle armstrong)== --> poem's which often question, qualify themselves

Source 6 - Vt poets try to speak with several voices in order to give a voice to their uncertainty
- Vt poetry as unstable compounds rather than single straightforward entitites

* turning the Vt poets into caricatures (our image of Vt poets vs who they really were - ==Matthew Sweets, Inventing Victorians==)

Source 9: Tennyson
- self-involved, there is a queiter voice hidden
- "half a league" - regular dectales - establish an unstoppable momentum
- publication in the examiner, surrounded by many other contexts/texts -- paratexts that question tennyson's poem 
	- produces a whle series of distorted images
	- a series of different perspectives on the same plot
- the poem overlaps various perspectives on each other
	- verse comes from the latin *vertere - to turn*
	- uses line ending, to envision the possibility of the brigade turning away, back before the momentum carries them forward
	- "theirs but to do and die" flattens out the gunho proclamation of "do or die"
	- pause btw "some one" highlights the pain of an infividual
	- the metre of the poem, allows us to heaer the event unfolding
		- 1. Cavalry between every hoof beat
		- 2. POV of their horrified observers
	- neatly ordered verse, shpws the danger of duty, but also puts up a little show of resistance through the speech that snags at the metre ("knew")
	- poetryarchive.org (recording of tennyson)
- TS elliot abt Tennyson: an instinctive rebel against the society in which he was the most perfect conformists - what starts as a single voice splits and multiplies -> entaphinal voice of the hecler?  (George Elliot, Redeeming the Time)
	- dialogue of the mind with itself  (George) reveals the dialogue of the poem with itself (Armstrong)

monopolilogues?

Tennyson - Maud and other poems
- Dialogue of books with itself

characteristics of Vt Poetry
* instability of the poets voice
* poets often contain critical reflections on themselves (as if they are footnotes)
* **importance of form**
	* when tradition encounters innovation (when a standard form is warped slightly - deformed/reformed --> particularly in response to a poets feelings that old shapes might not fulfill new shapes)
	* Meredith - Modern Love, 60 line sonnets that chart breakdown of a marriage (off-kilter rhythms and rhymes that dont match properly)

Source 11
- disintegration of rhythm --> sensitive mind not in unity with himself but also someone lost in unity with other people --> the voice doesnt fix, it falls out of a traditional social rhythm

Why are Vt potes so worried?
- Victiorian age was one of industry and commerce rather than poetry (See Source 12)
	- "unpoetical" - slightly archaic/arched --> contains and carries arnold's fears that poetry was increasingly the relic of a bygone age
	- Source 13 by Dickens
	- "The hero as Poets"
	
	- Source 14: a gap between the poet and audience that is more than just physical

What does it mean to be a victorian poet and therefore a post-romantic poet?
- were they carrying on their predescessors work? or suffering from a fear that all that has been good has already been sung
- victorian poetry was stuck between 2 worlds (Source 16)
	- wanting to reflect modern life
	- but terrified of only being a painful parody of what has come before

- Vt already has its rival in the 'novel'
	- Source 17: Refusing to compete by writing to a like-minded audience/treating poetry as a form of escapism
		- pastral echoes, archaisms, "hey!" --> exercise in cultural nostalgia --> published vs Hardy,,, designed to transport us back to a simplet past
	- Source 18: borrowing the novel's linguistic informality and loose construction and trying to incorporating it in poetry
		- Aurora Leigh - blank verse (no fix centre)
			- A romantic plot, an artist's novel, tells a story of how someone became a poet // David copperfield
		- echoes fiction in a way it tries to capture the clutter and contingency of moral life
			- writing that frequently bulges as it tries to accomodate the teeming life
			- should examine distance events closely, but also provide a sense of perspective for events that lie closer to home
			- individual lines allow the speaker to isolate key features of modern life ("mirror of its drawing-rooms"); the writing continually zooms in and out,
			- but the speaker's voice also shows straing "their age, not charle.... throbbing age" --> the rhythm wobbles, and then rights itself and adds in an extra syllable --> as if real life/prose will always seep into
				- prose emerging from verse OR
				- verse emerging from prose - how poetry can alwys find a place for itself


Source 19: Poetrry as a cultural brink
- a way of trying to conserve the past

Source 20:
- "forward forward" - stutters on the page while picking up the momentum

Source 21
- James Henry - echo of Macbeth "tomorrow and tomorrow"
- Rossetti: steady drift of snowflakes that are as indistinguishible from each other as the repition snow, words as a figuritive snowfall
**==> both answer Arnold's hope of Poetry answering to Culture as a from of Stay in this "present hurrying age"**

Source 22
- Tennyson: his poems break down into silence from which they had come
	- space between first line and second line, (on its own, the first line doesnt give us any direction on how to interpret it --> putting 3 stesses is unusal --> lyrical prose can become meaningless babble

==> a peculiar kind of double-vision (one eye ont he world of their readers, and the other on their own workings --> the real subject of the poem tends to be abt themselves as they worry about what is being written, who is reading then...)
