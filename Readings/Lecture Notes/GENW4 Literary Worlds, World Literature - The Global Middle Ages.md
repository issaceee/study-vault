# Literary Worlds: Global Middle Ages — The Moon and the Medieval Imagination  
### Oxford Prelims Paper 2 (700–1500) — Lecture by [Name Redacted for Consistency], 2025  

---

## Introduction: Reading the World through the Moon  

This lecture introduces the concept of the **Global Middle Ages**, a framework that challenges Eurocentric narratives of medieval culture by emphasising **interconnection** — cultural, linguistic, and spiritual — across continents. It also focuses on a recurring symbol shared by human societies across time: **the moon**.  

From early English verse to classical Japanese narrative, medieval writers imagined the moon as a site of longing, exile, and transcendence. By reading an anonymous **English alliterative poem, “The Man in the Moon”** (c.1300), alongside the **Japanese prose tale *The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter*** (*Taketori Monogatari*, 9th–10th c.), the lecture demonstrates how global comparison reframes medieval literature as a world system of imagination, not an insular European tradition (Evans 2025).  

> **Mini-Essay — The Moon as Mirror**  
> The moon becomes a natural metaphor for global literary study: it is both singular and universal, distant yet visible to all. To look at the moon is to participate in an ancient, shared act of imagination — one that reveals how the medieval world was always already global.

## I. The Global Middle Ages: A Framework  

### Defining the Global Middle Ages  

The term **“Global Middle Ages”** was coined by **Geraldine Heng** to describe a medieval world already shaped by transcontinental exchange — of goods, stories, religions, and ideas. It “foregrounds interconnectivity,” tracing “the braiding together of cultures, stories, and technologies across vast distances” (Heng 2015).  

**Catherine Holmes** and **Naomi Standen** remind us that global history did not begin with European imperialism: “Voyages of discovery did not start in the fifteenth century; interconnection has always been a part of human experience” (Holmes & Standen 2018).  

The approach aims to **decentre Europe** and to understand the medieval as a genuinely global epoch. Yet this perspective also demands **care and self-consciousness**. Critics such as **Nora Berend** and **Rebecca D’Souza** argue that “global” can be “too vague and too misleading” a term, and that the model risks reproducing the same Eurocentrism it seeks to overcome (Berend 2016; D’Souza 2020).  

> **Mini-Essay — Decentring the Centre**  
> To think globally about the Middle Ages is not to universalise Europe but to provincialise it. The challenge is to listen to other temporalities — to imagine history as a web rather than a ladder. The Global Middle Ages asks not what “the rest of the world” was doing while Europe “progressed,” but how every region participated in shaping shared human questions.

### The Problem of “Medieval”  

Even the word *medieval* is culturally loaded. It derives from the Latin *medium aevum* — “middle age” — coined to describe the *European* period between the fall of Rome and the Renaissance. When applied to other regions, it can distort or obscure local histories.  

- In **Europe** and **Islamic regions**, “medieval” often means 500–1500 CE.  
- In **China**, it may stretch from the fall of the Han dynasty (220 CE) to the fall of the Yuan dynasty (1368 CE).  
- In **Russia**, it can reach as late as the seventeenth century.  

To speak of a “Global Middle Ages,” therefore, requires **translation** — both linguistic and temporal. It means recognising that “medieval” describes different historical rhythms in different places.  

> **Mini-Essay — Unfixing Time**  
> The medieval is not a fixed era but a *relation* — a way of thinking about the past’s proximity to the present. Like the moon’s phases, it waxes and wanes across cultures: at once a global constant and a local variation.

---

## II. Why the Moon?  

The lecture chooses the **moon** as an organising symbol because it is one of the few phenomena that unites human experience. Every civilisation has looked at it, measured its phases, and projected myths upon its face. In medieval writing, the moon often symbolises **change, distance, and desire** — themes that also describe the relation between worlds.  

As **Edgar Williams** writes, “Virtually every well-known writer has used the moon’s characteristics to set the scene — the romantic moonlit night, the ghostly darkness, or the supernatural full moon” (Williams 2012). **Carol Ann Duffy**, in her anthology *To the Moon and Back*, calls the moon “the supreme image for poets” — a light shared across languages.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Moon as World Literature**  
> To study the moon is to study connection. Its constancy provides a common vocabulary for isolation, exile, and hope. The Global Middle Ages, like the moon, is a way of seeing continuity in diversity: each region reflects the same light differently.

## III. The Man in the Moon — England, 14th Century  

### Origins of the Myth  

Medieval Europeans imagined a **man imprisoned on the moon**, eternally bearing a bundle of thorns. The myth stems from a biblical passage in *Numbers 15:32–36*, where a man is punished for gathering sticks on the Sabbath. Later storytellers adapted the figure into a lunar exile: punished, not killed, condemned to carry his burden forever.  

**Albert of Saxony** (14th c.) records his perplexity: “I have seen the black spot there, but in no way could I see such a figure as some say is apparent, namely a man bearing a load of thorns” (Albertus 1360). His disbelief proves the myth’s ubiquity — most people *did* see the man.  

Versions differ across Europe:  
- In **Germany**, the man is exiled for working on Sunday.  
- In **Flanders**, a husband and wife are sent to the moon for labouring on holy days.  
- In **England**, the man steals thorns to mend his hedge.  
- In **some legends**, he is **Cain**, condemned to wander eternally after murdering Abel, a reading found in **Dante’s *Inferno* XV**.  

### The English Poem  

An anonymous **Middle English alliterative lyric**, *The Man in the Moon* (Harley MS 2253, c.1300–1350), recounts this legend in a tone both comic and tragic. The poem begins:  

> “The man in the moon stands and strides on his forked stick;  
> He bears his burden of thorns — it is a wonder he does not fall.”  

The speaker observes the lunar figure from Earth, commenting on his labour, his trembling, and his isolation. The man’s name, the poem reveals, is **Hubert**. The speaker schemes to free him from his lunar pledge by tricking the *heyward* (bailiff) into drunkenness. Yet the plan fails: Hubert cannot hear him. The poem ends in frustration — an unanswered call across the heavens.  

### Form and Audience  

The poem is written in **alliterative metre**, recalling Old English verse. It survives in the **Harley Manuscript**, a trilingual anthology (Latin, French, and English) that juxtaposes devotional and comic works. Its context suggests a performance audience — possibly students or mixed gatherings (Green 2008).  

The surrounding texts include both pious legends and bawdy satires, reinforcing the poem’s tonal ambiguity: is it a mockery of rustic superstition or a meditation on isolation?  

> **Mini-Essay — Laughter and Lament**  
> The poem’s humour is double-edged. Its rustic speaker, trying to “save” the man in the moon, mirrors human folly: our yearning to redeem what is beyond reach. The laughter of the audience may conceal unease — the recognition that the moon’s exile is also our own.

### Themes of Exile and Communication  

The poem dramatizes **failed connection**. The speaker oscillates between second and third person — addressing the man directly (“you”) and then speaking of him (“he”). This grammatical instability mirrors the cosmic gap between Earth and moon, between sympathy and distance.  

The man’s burden of thorns recalls **Christ’s crown**, recasting the myth as a parody of suffering and salvation. His endless toil on the moon evokes the **labourer’s condition on Earth** — a peasant’s punishment for working on holy days transformed into eternal servitude.  

> **Mini-Essay — Exile as Reflection**  
> The man in the moon’s punishment turns social hierarchy into cosmic allegory. His isolation mirrors the exclusion of the poor from medieval salvation. In watching him, the poem’s audience glimpses their own distance from grace: the moon is both mirror and warning.

## IV. The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter — Japan, 9th–10th Century  

### The Earliest Japanese Tale  

Across the world, another story of lunar exile was taking shape. **The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter** (*Taketori Monogatari*) is widely considered the **earliest extant Japanese prose narrative**, written in the late ninth or early tenth century. It tells of a moon princess, **Kaguya-hime**, who descends to Earth, is adopted by an old bamboo cutter and his wife, grows into a woman of transcendent beauty, and must eventually return to her celestial home.  

Her suitors — princes and nobles — undertake impossible quests to win her hand: to find Buddha’s begging bowl, a jewel from a dragon’s neck, a robe of fire-rat fur. All fail. Even the Emperor, who loves her sincerely, cannot prevent her return to the moon.  

### Exile in Reverse  

Unlike the English legend, where a mortal is exiled *to* the moon, Kaguya-hime is exiled *from* it. She belongs to the celestial realm but is sentenced to inhabit Earth — a reversal that transforms punishment into tenderness. As she tells her earthly parents:  

> “When I look at the moon, the world seems lonely and sad. How could I live without gazing at it?”  

Her sorrow prefigures the poem’s tragic climax: when the moon people arrive to reclaim her, she dons a feather robe that erases her memory of Earthly love. The Emperor receives her parting gift, the **elixir of immortality**, but refuses to drink it, burning it on a mountaintop — said to be the origin of *Mount Fuji* (literally “immortal fire”).  

> **Mini-Essay — The Exile of Return**  
> The tale reverses the Christian paradigm of fall and redemption. Here, exile from the perfect world (the moon) becomes the condition for discovering love, mortality, and compassion. To return to perfection is to lose feeling. Earth, though “filthy,” is the only place where tenderness exists.

### Performance and Symbolism  

**Richard Okada** notes that *Taketori Monogatari* employs a theatrical style of narration, alternating between omniscient prose and direct dialogue, echoing oral storytelling traditions (Okada 1991). The moon thus becomes both stage and spectator — the story’s invisible audience.  

The princess’s impossible tasks draw upon a syncretic mix of **Buddhist, Daoist, and Shintō** motifs: the begging bowl (ascetic renunciation), the jewel (imperial power), the robe (purity and transformation). As **Jonathan Stockdale** observes, the tale “reverses the logic of empire”: the Emperor’s authority fails before the moon’s gentle transcendence (Stockdale 2014).  

> **Mini-Essay — The Politics of the Celestial**  
> The tale’s moon-world exposes the limits of human order. Against courtly ambition and masculine conquest, it posits a feminine otherworld governed by sincerity and detachment. Kaguya-hime’s refusal to marry becomes a political act — a withdrawal from patriarchy and power.

## V. Comparative Reflections: Global Exile  

Placed side by side, *The Man in the Moon* and *The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter* reveal striking **cross-cultural parallels**. Both imagine the moon as a realm of estrangement — a site where moral law becomes exile, where communication fails across worlds.  

Yet their moral geographies invert:  
- In England, the moon is **punishment**; in Japan, it is **home**.  
- In the English poem, the **poor** are banished upward; in the Japanese tale, the **divine** descends downward.  
- Both, however, hinge on **distance** — the unbridgeable gap between the viewer and the viewed.  

The moon thus becomes an emblem of the **Global Middle Ages** itself: a shared but differently mapped world.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Global Moon**  
> The same symbol carries opposite meanings across continents, yet both stories use it to negotiate exile, belonging, and communication. The moon is not a metaphor borrowed from one culture to another; it is a space of mutual reflection — a global commons of imagination.

---

## VI. Conclusion: Reading Across Worlds  

By juxtaposing an English lyric and a Japanese prose romance, we discover that medieval literature was never provincial. Its imaginative horizons already extended across oceans. The **Global Middle Ages** does not homogenise difference; it reveals how similar desires — for connection, redemption, and home — manifest through diverse mythologies.  

The man in the moon strains to hear the Earth’s voice but cannot. The moon princess yearns to stay on Earth but must forget. Between them lies the tragedy of all human relation: to love what we cannot reach.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Ethics of Distance**  
> To read globally is to embrace distance, not abolish it. Comparison is not conquest but conversation. Like the moon, literature reflects light that comes from elsewhere — reminding us that every culture illuminates the others.

## Motif Tracker  

| **Motif** | **Example(s)** | **Interpretive Use** |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **The Moon / Celestial Realm** | *The Man in the Moon*; *Taketori Monogatari* | A shared symbol across cultures: the moon as both home and exile, connection and distance. |
| **Exile and Return** | Hubert’s banishment; Kaguya-hime’s enforced homecoming | The moral inversion of exile: punishment for the earthly sinner versus transcendence for the celestial being. |
| **Voice and Silence** | The speaker’s unanswered call to Hubert; Kaguya-hime’s wordless departure | Cross-cultural meditation on failed communication between worlds. |
| **Labour and Suffering** | Hubert’s endless burden of thorns; the Emperor’s futile resistance | Labour as both punishment and love; persistence in futility becomes moral revelation. |
| **Human and Divine Realms** | Biblical man on the moon; Buddhist and Daoist symbolism in *Taketori* | The blurred border between moral, spiritual, and cosmic hierarchies. |
| **Gender and Power** | The female moon princess; the powerless male labourer | Inversion of earthly hierarchies: the punished man and the divine woman redefine authority. |
| **Communication / Distance** | Hubert’s deafness; the moon’s unreachable beauty | The metaphor of global interconnection — desire for understanding across languages and faiths. |
| **Mortality and Memory** | The Emperor burning the elixir; the unending exile on the moon | Forgetting as a form of death; immortality as the loss of emotion and attachment. |

## Critical Lenses  

| **Axis** | **Relationship** | **Implication** |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Local ↔ Global** | Medieval stories as part of a world system of imagination | Global Middle Ages situates regional myths in a shared symbolic order. |
| **Human ↔ Divine** | Movement between earth and moon | Articulates moral order and hierarchy through celestial geography. |
| **Punishment ↔ Redemption** | English exile vs. Japanese return | Opposite moral logics that converge in shared existential anxiety. |
| **Speech ↔ Silence** | Failed communication across worlds | Symbolises limits of human knowledge and the ethics of listening. |
| **Temporal ↔ Eternal** | The moon’s unchanging light vs. human mortality | Cosmic perspective relativises earthly time; the moon as eternal witness. |
| **Suffering ↔ Compassion** | Labouring sinner vs. sorrowing princess | Both figures reveal empathy through endurance — universalising pain as moral insight. |
| **Gender ↔ Authority** | Male punishment vs. female transcendence | Reconfigures spiritual power and gendered agency in global myth. |
| **Center ↔ Periphery** | Earth as exile or “filthy place” | Inverts anthropocentric assumptions; decentralises human and European dominance. |

## Exam Relevance  

### Core Relevance to Oxford Prelims Paper 2 (700–1500)  

- Expands **medieval literature** beyond English and European boundaries.  
- Demonstrates **comparative close reading** as a method for decolonising early literary study.  
- Builds conceptual understanding of **translation, exile, and interconnection** as key frameworks for medieval texts.  
- Encourages use of **non-European examples** in essay questions about world-making, theology, and symbolism.  

### Analytical Skills  

- Identifying how universal symbols (the moon, exile, divine punishment) vary across traditions.  
- Integrating historical, linguistic, and spiritual contexts into close textual analysis.  
- Framing comparative argument without flattening cultural difference — balancing empathy with precision.  
- Applying *Global Middle Ages* theory to English texts to challenge Eurocentric assumptions.  

### Model Essay Patterns  

1. **“The moon unites all people in separation.”**  
   — Compare *The Man in the Moon* and *The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter* as global reflections on exile and belonging.  

2. **“Exile is the condition of understanding.”**  
   — Explore how alienation, both earthly and celestial, becomes the route to moral insight in medieval literature.  

3. **“The Global Middle Ages is not a new geography but a new way of listening.”**  
   — Discuss how translation and comparative reading uncover connections across seemingly distant worlds.  

4. **“Silence speaks louder than voice in medieval cosmology.”**  
   — Analyse how unhearing and forgetting reveal theological and emotional truths in the English and Japanese texts.  

### Revision Strategies  

- Review the **Harley Manuscript (BL MS Harley 2253)**: note its multilingual, mixed-genre composition.  
- Read *The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter* alongside **Daoist and Buddhist parables** about detachment.  
- Reflect on **linguistic plurality** as a medieval norm — manuscripts often contain Latin, French, and English side by side.  
- Practise framing comparative readings as *mutual illumination* rather than derivation: each text teaches us to reread the other.
