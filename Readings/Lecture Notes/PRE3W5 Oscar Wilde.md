## Oscar Wilde V: The Plays — *Performance, Politics, and the Mask*  
### Prof. Sos Eltis — Oxford Prelims Paper 3 (1830–1910)

---

## Introduction: Insincerity and Multiplicity  

The final lecture in the Wilde series turns to **the plays** — the height of Wilde’s theatrical achievement and the most paradoxical expression of his philosophy of performance.  
Prof. Sos Eltis begins with Gilbert’s claim in *The Critic as Artist*:  

> “What people call insincerity is simply a method by which we can multiply our personalities.”:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

Wilde transforms **insincerity** from moral flaw into creative principle.  
In *The Picture of Dorian Gray*, Dorian himself echoes this credo:  

> “Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely the method by which we can multiply our personalities.”:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

For Wilde, performance — deceit, pretence, fantasy — is not hypocrisy but **freedom**.  
Multiplicity defies judgement: the self cannot be fixed into “types” or “moral categories.”  
Every human being, Wilde insists, contains “myriad lives and myriad sensations.”:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

> **Mini-Essay — The Moral of Masks**  
> Wilde’s theatre turns morality inside out. The mask does not conceal truth; it reveals that truth is plural.  
> Sincerity becomes another costume — a pose more dangerous than artifice because it mistakes convention for authenticity.

---

## I. Performance and Society  

Wilde’s philosophy of the performed self emerges from a critique of Victorian conformity.  
In *The Soul of Man under Socialism* he argues that social kindness disguises coercion:  

> “People go through their lives in a sort of coarse comfort, like petted animals... thinking other people’s thoughts, living by other people’s standards, wearing other people’s second-hand clothes.”:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

Society enforces its values not through punishment but through **performance** — the unconscious acting of respectability.  
The only defence, Wilde suggests, is to perform **knowingly** — to turn self-presentation into art.  

> **Mini-Essay — Acting as Resistance**  
> Wilde’s self-conscious performance, from his clothes to his conversation, becomes political defiance: an aesthetic strategy against the homogenising violence of “normality.”  

---

## II. Theatrical Contexts: Melodrama and Modernism  

### Melodrama’s Moral Certainties  

Victorian melodrama, Eltis notes, depended on revelation and resolution:  
hidden sins exposed, false identities revealed, virtue rewarded.  
As Peter Brooks observed in *The Melodramatic Imagination* (1976):  

> “Nothing is spared because nothing is left unsaid... characters utter the unspeakable and dramatize the whole of their relationship.”:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

Melodrama replaces theology and law: truth appears through **recognition and confession**.  
Wilde inherits these conventions — the fallen woman, the hidden letter, the blackmail — but subverts them.  

> **Mini-Essay — Wilde’s Anti-Melodrama**  
> Wilde rewrites revelation as reinvention. His characters confess only to change the terms of guilt; exposure becomes another mask.  
> Where melodrama ends in moral clarity, Wilde’s theatre ends in ambiguity — a re-knotting rather than an untying.

### Ibsen and Psychological Modernism  

By the early 1890s, Ibsen’s *A Doll’s House* (1889) and *Ghosts* (1891) had revolutionised English theatre with layered psychology and social critique:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.  
Ibsen’s “well-made plays” expose self-deception rather than evil, showing how **society manufactures identity**.  

Wilde draws on both Ibsen and melodrama, blending high moral debate with witty artifice.  
Where Ibsen’s Nora walks into the dark to discover herself, Wilde’s heroines walk into society’s light — performing rather than escaping their roles.

> **Mini-Essay — Wilde after Ibsen**  
> Ibsen sought truth through sincerity; Wilde finds truth in performance.  
> His characters achieve freedom not by rejecting masks but by choosing which to wear.

---

## III. Women, Performance, and Power  

### Mrs Arbuthnot: “Child of My Shame”  

In *A Woman of No Importance* (1893), Mrs Arbuthnot refuses the marriage that would “legitimise” her past.  
Her climactic monologue turns repentance into rebellion:  

> “How could I repent of my sin when you, my love, were its fruit?... It is my dishonour that has made you so dear to me.”:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

Her words blend religious and erotic registers, biblical cadence and self-assertion.  
Yet Wilde ironises the very language she uses: the rhetoric of sin and shame both empowers and confines her.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Sincerity Trap**  
> Mrs Arbuthnot’s “confession” performs sincerity but dissolves meaning: love and sin, repentance and pride, collapse into each other.  
> Wilde’s heroines occupy a liminal zone between victimhood and authorship — their eloquence both liberating and entrapping.

---

## IV. *An Ideal Husband* (1895): Politics and Performance  

### Plot in Brief  

Sir Robert Chiltern, a respected politician, is blackmailed by Mrs Cheveley for having sold a cabinet secret in his youth.  
His wife, Lady Chiltern, worships him as “the ideal husband.”  
Meanwhile, Lord Goring — the languid dandy — manipulates secrets, brooches, and love letters to engineer a resolution that exposes everyone’s hypocrisy:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}.  

The play fuses **political intrigue, moral debate, and drawing-room comedy**, appealing simultaneously to gallery and stalls.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Play of Publics**  
> Wilde, asked which “public” he wrote for, replied: “Which public? There are as many publics as there are personalities.”:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
> His drama refuses a single audience or a single moral; it performs multiplicity even in reception.

### Melodrama in Reverse  

Reviewers described *An Ideal Husband* as “genteel melodrama.” One complained that it would “fill us with joy over the escape of a sinner from the penalty of his sin through a trick with a diamond bracelet.”:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
But Wilde inverts melodramatic justice: the corrupt politician triumphs, the blackmailer fails, and morality remains uncertain.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Criminal as Hero**  
> Sir Robert’s sin is enterprise, his success a reward for intelligent wrongdoing.  
> Wilde’s sympathy for the fallen man transforms the Victorian cult of virtue into a satire on political hypocrisy.  

### Shaw’s Review  

George Bernard Shaw grasped the paradox best:  

> “In a certain sense, Mr Wilde is our only thorough playwright... He plays with everything — wit, philosophy, drama, actors, audience.”:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

Shaw praised the play’s **playfulness**, its refusal of thesis or sermon.  
He also noted its sentimentality: Wilde the satirist is “the most sentimental dramatist of the day.”  
This mixture of levity and tenderness defines Wilde’s theatre.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Seriousness of Play**  
> Wilde’s “plays without a thesis” dramatise freedom itself — not moral lessons but ethical thinking-in-motion.  
> His wit becomes dialectic, a conversation without conclusion.

---

## V. Gender, Idealism, and the Public Sphere  

Lady Chiltern, an activist for women’s rights and factory reform, embodies political idealism.  
Her husband’s corruption tests the boundary between **public morality** and **private virtue**.  

Stage directions describe him as a man divided:  
> “The firmly chiselled mouth and chin contrast strikingly with the romantic expression in the deep-set eyes.”:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  

This schism between intellect and passion, male and female, head and heart, mirrors the division of **public and domestic spheres**.  

> **Mini-Essay — Separate Spheres, Shattered Boundaries**  
> The play stages the collision of two ideals: masculine pragmatism and feminine purity.  
> Wilde’s irony lies in showing how both destroy empathy; true morality requires theatrical compromise — the art of acting understanding.

At the end, Goring persuades Lady Chiltern to support her husband’s ambition with a speech about the “curves of emotion” and “lines of intellect.”  
Is this moral resolution or relapse into patriarchy?  Wilde leaves it undecided.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Question of Resolution**  
> Every moral speech in *An Ideal Husband* cancels the last.  
> The play becomes a dialogue of incompatible ethics — a theatrical symposium where contradiction itself is the truth.

---

## VI. The Criminal as Christ  

Wilde’s sympathy for transgression, Eltis notes, recalls his argument in *The Soul of Man under Socialism*:  

> “Disobedience, in the eyes of anyone who has read history, is man’s original virtue... It is finer to take than to beg.”:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}

Crime, in Wilde’s imagination, is creativity misnamed.  
Sir Robert Chiltern’s fraud becomes an act of survival within a corrupt order — a version of Wilde’s Christ-like rebel.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Gospel of Rebellion**  
> Wilde’s moral heresy is theological: sin is sanctified as self-expression.  
> In a world of false laws, only the lawbreaker can embody truth.  

---

## VII. Theatre of Surfaces  

The first production of *An Ideal Husband* (Haymarket Theatre, 1895) dazzled with **Worth couture gowns** and lavish sets arranged by Florence Alexander:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}.  
Cabinet ministers and financiers — Wilde’s real-life “ideal husbands” — sat in the stalls watching themselves parodied on stage.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Mirror Stage**  
> Wilde turns the theatre into society’s looking-glass.  
> The décor of hypocrisy reflects its audience: morality becomes a question of lighting and costume.  

As Mrs Cheveley declares, “Morality is simply the attitude we adopt towards people whom we dislike.”  
Wilde’s stage converts moral philosophy into **set dressing** — an artifice so polished that sincerity itself appears vulgar.

---

## VIII. Wilde’s Curtain Speech  

At the première of *Lady Windermere’s Fan*, Wilde addressed the audience:  

> “Ladies and gentlemen, I have enjoyed this evening immensely... I congratulate you on the great success of your performance, which persuades me that you think almost as highly of the play as I do myself.”:contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}

The joke makes the audience his collaborators — performers of meaning.  
This blurring of playwright, actor, and spectator completes his philosophy of theatre.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Audience as Artist**  
> Wilde’s theatre invites interpretation as participation.  
> Every laugh, every judgement, is another performance — the critic becomes co-creator.

---

## Conclusion: Wilde’s Theatre of Freedom  

Across his plays, Wilde fuses Ibsen’s psychological realism with melodrama’s emotional excess, creating a new dramatic ethics grounded in **performance**.  
He teaches that truth is plural, sincerity performative, morality theatrical.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Ethics of Play**  
> Wilde’s drama rejects the singular moral voice.  Its virtue lies in multiplicity — the art of balancing irony and compassion.  
> As Shaw wrote, Wilde “plays with everything” — and through that play, liberates both theatre and audience from the tyranny of the one true self.

| **Gender and Spheres** | Lady Chiltern’s idealism; Mrs Arbuthnot’s refusal | Collision of moral codes; feminine purity and masculine pragmatism re-scripted. |
| **Audience as Collaborator** | Wilde’s curtain speech; Shaw’s reviews | Theatre as reciprocal creation; spectators perform interpretation. |
| **Surface and Depth** | Gowns, décor, costume | Aesthetics as ethics; morality visualised in ornament. |

## Critical Lenses  

| **Axis** | **Relationship** | **Implication** |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Morality ↔ Artifice** | Truth discovered through performance | Ethics reimagined as aesthetic judgement. |
| **Sincerity ↔ Hypocrisy** | Collapse of moral binary | Every moral stance revealed as role-playing; authenticity as illusion. |
| **Public ↔ Private** | Political scandal vs. domestic virtue | Theatre as critique of Victorian gendered ethics. |
| **Society ↔ Self** | Social masks and inner multiplicity | Identity produced through external roles; selfhood as theatrical construction. |
| **Law ↔ Rebellion** | Sin as creative act | Criminality as innovation; social transgression becomes moral insight. |
| **Text ↔ Performance** | Wilde’s stage directions and delivery | Written irony completed only in performance; wit as embodied thinking. |
| **Comedy ↔ Tragedy** | Joyous surface concealing pain | The comic frame as protection for radical critique. |
| **Audience ↔ Actor** | Wilde’s dialogue with spectators | Reception becomes part of authorship; theatre as participatory art. |

## Exam Relevance  

### Core Relevance to Prelims Paper 3 (1830–1910)

- Introduces Wilde’s **philosophy of performance** and selfhood — central to Victorian and modern drama.  
- Illuminates how **melodrama, social comedy, and aestheticism** intersect in late nineteenth-century theatre.  
- Prepares students for essays on **gender, morality, and theatricality** across Aestheticism and Modernism.  
- Builds conceptual links between Wilde’s prose (e.g. *The Critic as Artist*) and his stagecraft.  

### Analytical Skills  

- Interpreting **dialogue as dialectic**: how repartee enacts ethical debate.  
- Analysing **stage direction, costume, and décor** as visual rhetoric.  
- Contextualising Wilde within **melodrama and Ibsenite realism**.  
- Balancing textual analysis with **performance history and reception**.  

### Model Essay Patterns  

1. **“All art is a mask.”** — Examine Wilde’s use of disguise, irony, and performance across the plays.  
2. **“The criminal is the truest artist.”** — Discuss Wilde’s moral inversion in *An Ideal Husband* and *A Woman of No Importance*.  
3. **“Comedy is Wilde’s form of criticism.”** — Explore how wit and humour operate as ethical method.  
4. **“To act is to live.”** — Analyse Wilde’s philosophy of performance as liberation from Victorian sincerity.  

### Revision Strategies  

- Compare *An Ideal Husband* with Ibsen’s *A Doll’s House*: exposure vs. ambiguity.  
- Review Wilde’s public writings (*Soul of Man*, *Critic as Artist*) for his aesthetic theory.  
- Practise reading scenes in both **textual and performance** modes — attention to tone, gesture, and costume.  
- Note Wilde’s contradictions: satire of hypocrisy intertwined with nostalgia for emotion.
