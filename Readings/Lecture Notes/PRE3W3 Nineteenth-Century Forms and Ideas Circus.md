## 19th Century Theatre and Science

- Theatre as engaging all scientific ideas, in the forefront,, engaging with ideas/discoveries at the point of emergence + changing the revelations
- not an obedient rendering of the science, it sometimes changes it/mutilates it
- playing a role in disseminating knowledge

* **Evolutionary Thought** - within biology, esp. heredity and evolution
	* How do species change, both on an indiv and group ...
	* theatre as the perfect form as staging the issue of visibility/invisibility (the speculative)

- Staging evolution
	- Henry Arthur Jones, "The relations of the Drama to Real Life," (1987 lecture)
		- the dramatist has at the most.... what Nature takes some hundred of years to portray
		- real time vs theatrcal time to signal smth so imperceptible and gradual, temporally vast
	- Role of Scenography (Displaying Nature)
		- Nature as spectacle: waterfalls, blizzards etc.
			- Key thing is about scale  
		- panoramic display: showing deep time or the oeath on show (see book of that name by Ralph O'Connor)
			- situate ourselves in the vast spectatcle of time, to be engulfed by the ??
			- how the human is totally dwarfed by nature
		- ethnological exhibits: commercialy displayed peoples, "performing" their way of life in zsoos throughout Europe
			- Sadiah Qureshi, Peoples on Parade (2011)
			- people could come up close with "The Other"
			- Nigel Rothfels (2002) - "Precisely this abundance of naturalness met with all the more approval. THe traw there.... it was necessary to retain security guards to keep order"
		- missing link shows: purporting to display intermediate species, "freaks" of nature
			- Jane R Goodall, Performance and Evolution in the Age of Darwin
				- purpoted to display evidence of "intermediate species"–filling in the gaps in the fossil record
		
		
		- innovation in playwrighting is driven by technology - theatricality, staging enables conditions to do that
		- illegitimate theatre (street theatre) - Ethnological and Missing Link shows
		
		

- Theatre's cultural centralirty - one of the chief ways that people get their ideas ==> vehicle for public consumption and debate - if we want to understand how science gets culturally embedded, we need to look at theatre as one of the mechanisms for dissemination of ideas
	- the period was of the rise of the beourguise where they could afford to buy stuff, consume ideas and theatre is at the forefront because of its variety
	- pantomine


- Zola on Naturalism in Theatre
	- plays that showed real life as if seen under a microscope -
	- vs idealism - uplifting, what should we do?
	- naturalism as what people do
	
	- Dan Rebellato's chapter on Objectivity in The Cambridge Companion to Theatre and Science, 2020
	
	- in this period, realism is new, revolutionary. **BUT its the illusion of reality (painted backdrops)
	- French positivism -  looking at various factors influencing people's behaviour (also at the moment when psychology is becoming a field) - what drives people? 
		- goes places that realism might not go to 

Evolution and Acting: Duse's Blush
- See Shepherd barr, Theatre and Evolution from Ibsen to Beckett (2015), pp. 55-62
- Actors are saying what can we do with our bodies, that often go unrecognised
- what
- multiple temporal spans and pulses happening at the same time
