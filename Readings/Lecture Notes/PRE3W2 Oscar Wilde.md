## Introduction: Wilde Between Two Worlds  

Oscar Wilde (1854–1900) stands on the threshold between **Victorianism and Modernism**, embodying both the confidence of the old century and the fragmentation of the new. His career — from *The Picture of Dorian Gray* (1891) to *The Importance of Being Earnest* (1895) and *De Profundis* (1897) — spans a period of cultural upheaval when literature itself was being redefined.  

Wilde’s work critiques **Victorian moralism** while preparing the ground for **modernist experimentation**: he is, as this lecture puts it, a “**midwife to modernism**,” loosening conventions so that new forms could emerge:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

> **Mini-Essay — Wilde’s Janus Face**  
> Wilde looks backward and forward at once. He perfects the paradoxical aphorism, the society play, and the aesthetic essay — yet each of these undermines Victorian certainty. The result is literature aware of its own artifice: at once decorative and destabilising, poised between moral drama and modern irony.

## I. Degeneration and the Fin de Siècle  

### Max Nordau and the Fear of Decay  

The 1890s — *fin de siècle*, or “end of the century” — were haunted by the rhetoric of decline. In *Degeneration* (1895), the critic **Max Nordau** describes a civilisation collapsing into moral and aesthetic disorder:

> “It means a practical emancipation from traditional discipline… to the voluptuary this means unbridled lewdness… to all, it means the end of an established order which for thousands of years has satisfied logic, fettered depravity, and matured something of beauty.”:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

Nordau’s hysteria reveals late-Victorian anxieties: sexual deviance, social rebellion, and aesthetic experiment were all symptoms of pathology. He names Wilde as the quintessential “degenerate type.”

> **Mini-Essay — Degeneration as Diagnosis**  
> Nordau’s pseudo-scientific language turns taste into illness. Art becomes a symptom to be cured. Wilde, by contrast, embraces individualism as health — the act of living aesthetically becomes resistance to conformity. The “disease” of modernity becomes its vitality.

---

## II. Wilde and the Reversal of Values  

### The Epigram and the Paradox  

Wilde’s genius lies in inversion — what George Bernard Shaw called “the dangerous subject” that makes critics “dull.” Shaw wryly noted:  

> “They protest that such epigrams can be turned out by the score… yet his plays remain unique. That says much for the self-denial of our scribes.”:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

The **epigram** — “Work is the curse of the drinking classes,” “I can resist everything except temptation” — becomes Wilde’s method of critique. By reversing clichés, he exposes how language itself polices morality.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Ethics of the Paradox**  
> Wilde’s wit is philosophy in miniature. Each reversal (“Disobedience is man’s original virtue”) reveals the fragility of inherited norms. The epigram, like modernist irony, fractures moral language to free new meanings.

---

## III. Utopian Socialism and Self-Realisation  

In *The Soul of Man under Socialism* (1891), Wilde transforms socialism into a manifesto of **aesthetic individualism**:  

> “A map of the world that does not include Utopia is not worth even glancing at… Progress is the realisation of Utopias.”:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

He rejects capitalism’s “worship of possession” but equally rejects authoritarian collectivism. For Wilde, socialism should liberate creativity — the machine should do the work so humans may live aesthetically.

### Wilde’s Christ as Artist  

In this essay, Christ becomes the archetype of the creative individual — “not Know thyself but Be thyself.” Salvation lies in self-realisation, not obedience.  

> **Mini-Essay — Utopia and Selfhood**  
> Wilde’s socialism is spiritual rather than economic. Freedom is aesthetic: to live beautifully, to turn life into art. His utopia anticipates modernist autonomy — the belief that creation justifies existence.

---

## IV. Art for Art’s Sake: The Preface to *The Picture of Dorian Gray*  

Wilde’s *Preface* (1891) distils the creed of **Aestheticism**:

> “There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written or badly written. That is all… All art is quite useless.”:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

These aphorisms reject art’s subservience to ethics or didacticism. Beauty alone is its justification.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Uselessness of Art**  
> “All art is quite useless” is not nihilism but provocation. By denying social utility, Wilde asserts art’s freedom. The useless becomes the indispensable condition of creativity. This paradox will echo in modernist aesthetics from Joyce to Woolf.

---

## V. The Public and the New  

Wilde’s defence of novelty prefigures modernism’s rebellion against tradition:  

> “The one thing that the public dislike is novelty… Art is Individualism, and Individualism is a disturbing and disintegrating force… The public make use of the classics as bludgeons for preventing the free expression of Beauty in new forms.”:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

Art’s duty is to disturb. The artist’s originality is a moral act against imitation.  

> **Mini-Essay — Against the Tyranny of Taste**  
> Wilde exposes how “the classics” become weapons of conformity. His plea for individualism anticipates Pound’s “Make it new” and Eliot’s “Tradition and the Individual Talent”: progress through dissent.

---

## VI. The Critic as Creator  

In *The Critic as Artist* (1891), Wilde redefines criticism as **creation**. Through his interlocutors Ernest and Gilbert, he dismantles Matthew Arnold’s dictum that the critic must “see the object as in itself it really is.”  

> “The proper aim of Criticism is to see the object as in itself it really is not… To the critic, the work of art is simply a suggestion for a new work of his own.”:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

Wilde reverses Arnold’s objectivity into subjectivity: art’s meaning lies in perception, not intention. The critic becomes artist, transforming the work through interpretation.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Death of Objectivity**  
> Wilde anticipates Barthes’s “Death of the Author.” Meaning is relational, not fixed. Criticism becomes an imaginative act — the modern essay as art form. Subjectivity, once heresy, becomes the source of aesthetic truth.

---

## VII. From Pater to Wilde: Impression and Isolation  

Wilde’s theory of subjective criticism derives from **Walter Pater’s** *Conclusion to The Renaissance* (1873):  

> “Experience… is ringed round by that thick wall of personality through which no real voice has ever pierced.”:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

For Pater, knowledge of beauty lies in discriminating one’s impressions. Wilde radicalises this into an epistemology of art: the critic’s self is the true object of contemplation.

> **Mini-Essay — From Impression to Modernism**  
> Pater isolates the individual within perception; Wilde transforms that isolation into power. Modernism inherits this subjectivity: stream-of-consciousness, interior monologue, and the fragmented self all grow from this aesthetic inward turn.

---

## VIII. Realism and “The Decay of Lying”  

Wilde’s dialogue *The Decay of Lying* (1889) parodies realism’s obsession with fact:  

> “Lying, the telling of beautiful untrue things, is the proper aim of Art.”  

He denounces the “modern mania for morality” in literature and celebrates invention. Art does not copy life; life imitates art.  

> **Mini-Essay — Imagination as Truth**  
> For Wilde, truth is not correspondence but creation. Art’s lies are higher truths — those that make reality imaginable. The artist’s lie becomes the modernist symbol: subjective, unstable, endlessly productive.

---

## IX. Salomé: From Decadence to Modernism  

Written in French (1891), *Salomé* embodies fin-de-siècle **Symbolism** and **Decadence**, yet it gestures toward modernist abstraction. Influenced by **Baudelaire**, **Mallarmé**, and **Maeterlinck**, the play transforms biblical narrative into ritualised language.  

> Salomé’s monologues (“Thy body is white like the lilies of the field…”) blur sensuality and sanctity, transforming desire into poetry.  

Language in *Salomé* is incantatory, not descriptive; rhythm and repetition generate meaning. Wilde’s use of colour, perfume, and sound anticipates multimedia performance and synaesthetic modern art.  

> **Mini-Essay — The Theatre of the Imagination**  
> In *Salomé*, words do not represent; they transfigure. Wilde’s sensory overload — visual, musical, olfactory — turns the stage into an art object. The play becomes a blueprint for avant-garde theatre, from Yeats and Stravinsky to Beckett.

---

## X. From Aestheticism to Modernism  

Wilde’s writings — especially the essays in *Intentions* — dismantle Victorian hierarchies between artist, critic, and audience. His defence of subjectivity, irony, and impressionism opens the door to **modernist experimentation**:

| Victorian Ideal | Wildean Reversal | Modernist Legacy |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Objectivity | Subjectivity | Stream of consciousness, interior monologue |
| Morality | Aesthetic autonomy | Art for art’s sake, formal innovation |
| Truth | Imagination | Symbolism, abstraction |
| Authority | Individualism | Anti-traditionalism, irony |
| Realism | Artifice | Metafiction, fragmentation |

> **Mini-Essay — Wilde as Midwife to Modernism**  
> Wilde’s contradictions — his insistence on beauty and his mockery of truth — make him the hinge of literary modernity. Without Wilde’s irony, there could be no Eliot; without his aesthetic self-consciousness, no Woolf. His century ends where ours begins.

---

## Motif Tracker  

| **Motif** | **Example(s)** | **Interpretive Use** |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Individualism** | *The Soul of Man under Socialism* | Aesthetic freedom as moral imperative. |
| **Paradox / Epigram** | *Earnest*, *Dorian Gray* | Language as critique; wit as ethics. |
| **Criticism as Creation** | *The Critic as Artist* | Subjectivity as artistic method. |
| **Surface and Depth** | *Salomé*, *Dorian Gray* | Beauty and corruption intertwined. |
| **Lying / Imagination** | *The Decay of Lying* | Fiction as higher truth; art reshapes reality. |
| **Public vs. Artist** | *Soul of Man* | Rebellion against collective taste. |

---

## Critical Lenses  

| **Axis** | **Relationship** | **Implication** |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Victorian ↔ Modernist** | Continuity and rupture | Wilde dissolves realism, invents aesthetic self-consciousness. |
| **Art ↔ Morality** | Inverse proportion | Ethical art is not moral but imaginative. |
| **Critic ↔ Creator** | Fusion | Reading as creation; meaning as invention. |
| **Society ↔ Self** | Conflict | Social control breeds artistic rebellion. |
| **Truth ↔ Artifice** | Mutual dependence | The lie as vehicle for beauty and insight. |

---

## Exam Relevance  

**For Paper 3 (1830–1910):**  
- Links directly to questions on **Aestheticism, Decadence, and the birth of Modernism**.  
- Demonstrates the relationship between **literary form, philosophy, and social change**.  
- Useful for comparative essays with Pater, Morris, Eliot, or early modernist prose and drama.  

### Model Essay Patterns  
1. *“Art is individualism, and individualism is a disturbing and disintegrating force.”* — Discuss Wilde’s conception of art and its relation to modernism.  
2. *“The critic is more creative than creation.”* — Explore Wilde’s challenge to Victorian ideas of authorship and its modernist implications.  
3. *“All art is quite useless.”* — Evaluate Wilde’s paradox as both defence of Aestheticism and prophecy of modernist autonomy.
