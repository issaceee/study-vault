# Seminar Notes
- ending of the novel bringing together North and South, how?
	- Marriage and Death
		- Death of Bessy
			- inevitability of death and to illustrate the failings of the industrial; relentlessness of Bessy's death that the Novel sort of skips past VS  Leonard's death that the Novel keeps harping on.
				- Nicholas Vs Mr Hale

- why doesn't unions solve the problems
	- "them or us" mentality - both the union vs the factory owners, and also within the working class (Butcher)
		- the union is as tyrranical as the masters

- so what does?
	- face to face conversation & a mutual vulnerability
		- can explain the death of Bessy - its true this interpersonal relationship of Bessy that Marget learns more authentically the plight of the working class (pg. 419 & 122)

- North & South - another difference is in the financial
	- how thats reconciled in the book is Margaret inheriting money and then investing that in Thronton's
	- another evil in the book is "speculation"
		- thronton's dad goes bankrupt
		- the boook wants harmony - if you have money, invest it in productive manufacturing of goods instead of speculation

- Train Scene
	- Isolation of Margaret's not telling of the truth
	- Going through this experience also makes Margaret more willing to marry him. the turn in their relationship seems to be from the sense of abjection and degrading
		- "in Mr Thornton's eyes, she is degraded"
		- insecurity is reflected in the conversation in the end (both fighting for who is not worthy - pg 436)
		- 
	- Moral ambiguity in the death and how the Novel actaully doesn't care about the death 
		- 


- A lot of emphasis on the dressing rooms = cultural differences

- strike scene

- takeaways for exams
	- criticised for its politics - the book kind of wraps up in a super abrupt and not entirely convincing way - trying to affect the reconiliation through the miracle of inheritance
		- political power of novels - invent solutions to real idological problems (ideology is like an imaginary solution to a real social contradiction) - the book therefore is trying to affect this reconciliation but the tensions in the real world cant just be wished to be sorted out, but the book is trying to invent a solution
			- the secens of mis/non communication - all of these social communications are real and that North and South cant come together - actl this can be read that if we realy try to get to know each other, there would be strife that these miscommunications are built into how all of these work
	- industrial novel (1830s-1840s)
		- responding to the tumult in the british economy
		- this is one way literature and Culture is being mobilised in the way that Arnold isnt really imagining - that literature can solve industrial
		- we've invented retrospectively invented the genre, whereas in the 19th century they were writing a Novel of Purpose, a bigger project than what the industrial novel represents/suggests (a big transatlantic genre - a middle class literature, they are imagining the reforms that can smooth out the tensions btw bossess and workers)
			- comes about in the wake of Enlightenment but also Engalicalism (delvelops instituttions and societies - all of these organisations that are created are absorbed in the 19th century to become the government)
			- charity vs reform
				- charity is religious, interpersonal
				- reform, mediations betw the novel
# Introduction

closeness of themes to Dickens' *Hard Times* - "industrial conditions as a matrix for personal relations"
- Dickens' - a moral fable presented in an uneasy mixture of realistic and emblematic characters and situations
- Gaskell's - a human **comedy** traced through consistent and developing characters set in conditions the **author understood from long personal experience**

Similarity - "Dickens had stressed the individual in hard Times, a moral fable which is often angularly schematic, often confused, and finally inadequate in offering the fun and games of Sleary's circus as a pancea for societys ills, yet where the pressure of institutions and the danger of the cash-nexus are clearly stated.... (Gaskell) exploration of an awakened consciousness receptive to environment"

"both writers show skill in presenting a young girl who must deal virtually unassisted with the unklwon"

Gaskell: "I dare say I shall like my story, when I am a little further from itl at present I can only feel depressed about it, I meant it to have been so much better" --> authorial distance


**Serialisation vs the Novel**
- How does this affect the message being told to the readers (on the writer's end?)
- How does this affect how the message is being read by the readers?
- Why exactly did Gaskell feel that such a format didn't allow for her story to be told faithfully


# Thoughts

- Perspective & Truth
	- The masters and the hands each have their own perspective of what is right and wrong, whether or not both are true
	- The Hales, as an outsider are in a privileged position of being a mediator between the two truths here, but this is only because they are outsiders
		- yet, because of being outsiders, the truth of some situations are also inaccessible to the Hales (they cannot relate to the plights of either)
		- yet, they also CAN relate to both
			- // bessy and Mrs Hale: in terms of being sick/being affected by the working conditions
			- // bessy and Margaret: in terms of being young teenage girls that are religious and trying to navigate
			- Margaret vs Edith (Margaret's could have been if she went with lennox?)
	- I think it'll also be interesting to consider the idea of religion here (one singular truth)
		- I think gaskell sets up a little bit of foreshadowing in highlighting first the father's struggle with the church and their one singular ideology, and this sets the precursor/context for the entire story and sturggle
		- There's also a lot of references/allusions within the story itself, i think it is an attempt to lend credibility to certain perspectives and truths, yet at the same time there is always other allusions to various other truths that call into question other truths


- Gaskell wrote that she would rather call her novel _Death and Variations_ because "there are five dead, each beautifully consistent with the personality of the individual".

1) Mr. Thornton's visit to the Hale's in Chapter 10; 
2) Margaret's early scenes with the Higgins's in Chapters 8, 11, and 13;
3) the strike in Chapter 22;
4) the scene where Margaret sees off Frederick on the train (and then Leonard dies and Margaret lies) in Chapters 32-34 and afterwards;
5) Margaret and Thornton's happy ending in Chapters 51 and 52.

**QUESTIONS**
- What is the problem with industrialization, according to Gaskell? How is it represented in the novel? What does Margaret learn from her relationship with the Higgins's? What values are associated with the "north" of England and the "south"? How does the novel reconcile these conflicting values?  
- How does the novel coordinate its romance plot with its social commentary? Why does Margaret reject Thornton at first? Why does she come around to him later?
	- Gaskell holds the romance genre and the condition-of-England genre at a balance, with each of the genres informing the plot and actions of its various characters. The novel seems to revolve mainly around the stereotypical romance "enemies-to-lovers" plot, one that is very familar to *Austen's Pride and Prejudice*
- What is the significance of the strike scene in Chapter 22? What does it suggest about the problems of industrial society? Is the book in favor of the union or against it?  
- The book is preoccupied with matters of conscience: Mr. Hale leaves the church for this reason; Frederick’s mutiny is cast in these terms too. Why is the novel so interested in conscience?  
-  The Train Station scene (weirdly?) receives a lot of attention in the novel — perhaps more than any other scene. Why? Did Frederick murder Leonard?

- "They were to hou'd together through thick and thinl what the major part thought, t'others

### ch. 6
- "The father and brother depended upon her; while they were giving way to grief, she must be working, planning, considering. Even the necessary arrangmenets for the funeral seemed to devolve upon her."

### ==ch. 7==


### ch. 8
- "No: because they can't control themselves. WOmen of our class don't go, because they have no power over their emotions, and yet are ashamed of showing them. Poor women go, and don't care if they are seen overwhelmed with grief. But I promise you, papa, that if you will let me go, I will be no trouble"
- "that the last visible token of the presence of his wife was to be carried away from him, and hidden from his sight"
- "Pray for me, Margaret. I have no strength left in me. I cannot pray. I give her up because I must. I try to bear it: indeed I do. I know it is God's will. But I cannot see why she died. Pray for me, Margaret, that I may have faith to pray"

- "It took a great moral effort to galvanise his trust–ere–while so perfect–in Margaret's pure and exquisite maidenliness, into life..."

### ==ch. 9==
- "There was something of infignation expressed in her countenance, but so kept down and controlled, that it gave her a superb air of disdain. There was no surprise, no curiosity. She stood awaiting the opening of his business there. Not a question did she ask."

### ch. 10
- "It was curious how the presence of Mr. Thornton had power over Mr Hale to make him unlock the secret thoughts which he kept shut up even from Margaret"
- "Man of action as he was, busy in the world's great battle, there was a deeper religion binding him to God in his heart, in spite of his strong wilfulness, through all his mistakes than Mr Hale had ever dreamed."

- "if he had but foreseen that she would have stained her whiteness by a falsefood"

- "Mr Thornton, above all people, on whjome she had looked down from her imaginary heights till now! She suddenly found herself at his feet and was strangely distressed at her fall."

- "Not humbled before God, as having failed in trust towards Him; not degraded and abased in Mr Thornton's sight" - "here was she calssing his low opinion of her alonside with the displeasure of God"
- "She believed that she could have borne the sense of Almighty displeasure, because He knew all, and could read her penitence, and hear her cries for help in time to come. But Mr. Thornton– why did she tremble, and hide her face in the pillow?"

- "she was not good enough, nor pure enough to be indifferent to the lowered opinion of a fellow creature;that the thought of how he must be looking upon her with contempt, stoood between her and her sense of wrong-doing"

- "Fomerly, Margaret would have come to him as priest as well as father, to tell him of her temptations nad her sin; but latterly they had not spoken much on such subjectsl and she knew not how, in his change of opinions, he would reply if the depth of her soul called unto his"

- "It would seem unfair–unkind to your mother, who always, I'm afraid, disliked Milton so much, if we left it now she is lying here, and cannot go with us."

### ch. 11
