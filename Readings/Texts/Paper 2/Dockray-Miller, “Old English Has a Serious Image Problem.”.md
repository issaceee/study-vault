"In 2017, as the American neo-Nazi movement that calls itself the “alt-right” is [resurrecting medievally tinged celebrations of “European heritage” as part of its racist agenda](https://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/510533/rebranding-white-nationalism-inside-the-alt-right/), twenty-first-century Anglo-Saxonists need to confront the racism inherent in the history of the discipline. The challenge is to communicate Anglo-Saxon history as part of a multicultural and inclusive public discourse."


"Outside the university, however, the phrase “Anglo-Saxon” did not refer to early medieval English. Instead, it was [racial and racist](http://www.jstor.org/stable/27711681?mag=old-english-serious-image-problem), freighted with assumptions of privilege and superiority. The cultural rhetoric of Manifest Destiny specifically defined “Anglo-Saxons” as superior to enslaved and free Africans, Native American Indians, Mexicans, and numerous other groups defined as non-white, including Irish and Italian immigrants."

" Crucial to the academic argument against this movement is vociferous insistence that the Middle Ages were never a celebration of white male aristocratic heroism, despite American popular perception of white knights in shining armor riding their warhorses through England and France."
