## PRE3W6 Tutorial Notes — *Moby-Dick* and Romance  
**Topic:** Genre, Romance, Truth, Epic, Industrial Novel, Allegory  
**Themes:** Genre failure, modern epic, epistemology, democracy, labour, dogma

---

## 1. Why *Moby-Dick* Is So Hard to Classify
The book resists all single-genre labels. It contains elements of:

- **Romance** (quest narrative, extremity, anti-realism)
- **Adventure fiction**  
- **Epic** (a modern, fractured epic rather than an ancient totalising one)
- **Industrial novel** (labour, lays/wages, workers’ collectivity)
- **Philosophical treatise** (digressions, metaphysics)
- **Biblical parable** (Jonah, names, sermon)
- **Grail quest** (aristocratic medieval romance template)
- **Encyclopaedia** / scientific taxonomy (cetology)

**Key idea:**  
*Moby-Dick*’s “genre” is the failure of all genres to capture the whale/truth.  
It becomes a **meta-genre** — a novel about the inadequacy of genres themselves.

---

## 2. Ishmael and the Fear of Dogma
Ishmael is consistently shown as:

- open-minded  
- anti-dogmatic  
- flexible, curious, ecumenical  
- resistant to rigid systems of belief  
- unsettled by certainty  

His scene with Queequeg (joining him in idol-worship) expresses:

- a rejection of religious exclusivity  
- a belief that *doing good to one’s fellow man* is the true “will of God”  
- an ethics of openness rooted in empathy rather than doctrine

Ishmael’s flexible worldview contrasts sharply with **Ahab’s monomaniacal certainty**.

**Ahab = dogmatic obsession**  
**Ishmael = openness, multiplicity, curiosity**

---

## 3. Cetology and the Futility of Truth-Seeking
In the cetology chapters, Ishmael admits:

- the whale “lives not complete in any literature”  
- any classification system will be incomplete  
- “any human thing supposed to be complete must be faulty”  
- he is “the architect, not the builder”  

**Key idea:**  
Classification is both **necessary** and **impossible**.  
The act of ordering the world becomes itself a model of human striving.

This mirrors the larger narrative:  
→ Truth cannot be captured  
→ Yet the *attempt* to know is meaningful  
→ The novel tries every register (science, philosophy, religion, epic, humour) and fails, but the failure is productive.

---

## 4. The Novel as Modern Epic
Ancient epics assume:

- unity of civilisation  
- total meaning across all parts  
- coherent cosmology  

*Moby-Dick* is the opposite:

- fractured  
- multi-voiced  
- contradictory  
- encyclopaedic without totality  

A “modern epic” captures the fragmentation of the modern world.

**Comparative lineage:**  
*Moby-Dick* → later “modern epics” like *Ulysses*, *In Search of Lost Time*.

---

## 5. Why Melville Rejects Genre
Genre is:

- a constraint  
- a stabilising structure  
- a way of telling readers “what reality is”  

Melville wants to resist anything that gives the illusion of:

- single truths  
- singular meaning  
- closure  
- total explanation  

Thus the novel is constantly switching modes to avoid becoming dogma.

Genre becomes another form of **Ahab-like monomania**.

---

## 6. Opening Page: “Call me Ishmael”
This famous line:

- breaks the fourth wall  
- refuses certainty about identity (is that really his name?)  
- invites the reader into intimacy  
- mirrors romance’s rejection of elegant, conventional openings  
- sets up a narrator who is both insider and outsider  

The first chapter also:

- expresses the **restlessness** of modern, urban workers  
- imagines the ocean as an escape from clerical alienation (cf. Bartleby)
- frames the sea as symbolic of freedom, possibility, and extremity  
- connects to romance traditions of leaving civilisation behind to seek truth

**Important:**  
The yearning for the sea is described as universal — “almost all men” — but also tied to modern white-collar drudgery and male-coded restlessness.

---

## 7. Romance vs Realism
In the 19th century:

- **Romance** = extremes, strangeness, adventure, meaning beyond the everyday  
- **Realism** = ordinary life, domesticity, moral sympathy, social detail  

Romance sees the everyday as **deadening**.  
Realism sees the everyday as **ethically meaningful**.

*Moby-Dick* positions itself with romance:

- meaning lies beyond conventions  
- ordinary life is stultifying  
- extremity is required to make meaning  
- truth lives behind masks

Romance becomes the anti-genre — a force that rejects constraint itself.

---

## 8. Industrial, Labour, and Economic Readings
The novel can also be read as an **industrial novel**:

- the ship as workplace  
- democratic crew structure  
- labour hierarchy (lays instead of wages)  
- international working-class community  
- shared purpose, shared danger  

This links *Moby-Dick* to novels like *North and South*:  
→ collective labour  
→ industrial risk  
→ economics of production (whale oil = energy)

Also: the eroticised “squeezing sperm” scene = utopian workers’ collectivity.

---

## 9. Political Allegory: Democracy and Dictatorship
Ahab is often read as:

- the tyrant-dictator  
- charismatic, violent, displacing rational governance  

Ishmael as:

- the liberal subject  
- open-minded, pluralistic  
- the survivor  

BUT modern critics note:

- Ahab’s power is enabled by *consent* of the crew  
- Ishmael participates in Ahab’s rituals  
- the workers cheer Ahab into authority  

Thus the novel critiques:

- democracy’s pliability  
- the seduction of charismatic leaders  
- the fragility of liberalism  

---

## 10. Ahab vs Ishmael: Two Modes of Reading
**Ahab reads the world as:**

- symbol  
- singular meaning  
- total, unified truth  
- one object = one explanation  

**Ishmael reads the world as:**

- multiple  
- partial  
- contradictory  
- open-ended  
- never finished  

They represent two interpretive stances:

- **Ahab = allegorical monomania** (dogmatic reading)
- **Ishmael = digressive curiosity** (plural reading)

The novel stages this contrast but never reconciles it.

---

## 11. Opposition as a Structural Principle
The book repeatedly insists:

> meaning is produced through contrast, not unity.

Examples:

- Warmth only exists beside cold (Ishmael/Queequeg in bed)  
- Ambergris: beauty derived from rot  
- Whale oil: light from death  
- The Pequod: democracy → dictatorship  
- Romance vs realism  
- Land vs sea  
- Knowledge vs incomprehensibility  

The novel **thrives on unresolved oppositions**.

---

## 12. Gender and Market Dynamics
In the American 19th century:

- **Romance** = often male authorship (Melville, Hawthorne)  
- **Sentimental fiction** = female authorship, huge sales  

Romance positions itself as:

- anti-market  
- anti-domestic  
- rejecting popular, profitable genres  

But it is also entangled with those markets:

- romance fails commercially  
- sentimental fiction sells  
- aesthetic hierarchy emerges (men = art, women = commerce)

*Moby-Dick* becomes a text caught between marketplace and anti-market ideals.

---

## 13. Final Synthesis

*Moby-Dick* as a whole is:

- a novel suspicious of all certainty  
- a romance rejecting the ordinary and the dogmatic  
- a modern epic built from fragmentation  
- an industrial novel about labour, capitalism, and collectivity  
- a political allegory about democracy’s dangers  
- a philosophical inquiry into truth, perception, and the limits of knowledge  
- a study in oppositions that refuses to resolve them  

The book does not offer truth.  
It stages the **human attempt** to grasp truth and the **necessary failure** of that attempt.



# Own Notes

grail quest - aristocratic culture
encyclopaedic
biblical parable
romantic/romance
political allegory (democracy works and dangers inherent in the democratic project)

industrial novel - in the US in the mid 19th, fossil fuel production is not very (actual real oil doesnt become a thing till 1860)
- whale oil as a sort of energy 

can read it alongside North and South - a group of workers coming together (lays and distribution of wages)


whats so bad about genre?
- Melville is very open to other readings
	- “I was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible Presbyterian Church. How then could I unite with this wild idolator in worshipping his piece of wood? But what is worship? thought I. Do you suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnan- . imous God of heaven and earth—pagans and all included—can possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood? Impossible! But what is worship?—to do the will of God—+that is worship. And what is the will of God?—to do to my fellow man what I would have my fellow man to do to me—+hat is the will of God. Now, Queequeg is my fellow man. And what do I wish that this Queequeg would do to me? Why, unite with me in my particular Presbyterian form of worship. Consequently, I must then unite with him in his; ergo, I must turn idolator. So I kindled the shavings; helped prop up the innocent little idol; offered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg; salamed before him twice or thrice; kissed his nose; and that done, we undressed and went to bed, at peace with our own consciences and all the world. But we did not go to sleep without some little chat.” (Melville and Blum, 2022, p. 112)
	- Ishmael represented as accumentamel guy against dogma (AHAB - monomiacle)



- pushing

“As yet, however, the sperm whale, scientific or poetic, lives not complete in any literature. Far above all other hunted whales, his is an unwritten life. Now. the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive classification, if only an easy outline one for the present, hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent laborers. As no better man advances to take this matter in hand, I hereupon offer my own poor endeavors. I promise nothing complete; because any human thing supposed to be complete, must for that very reason infallibly be faulty. I shall not pretend to a minute anatomical description of the various species, or—in this place at least—to much of any description. My object here is simply to project the draught of a systematization of cetology. I am the architect, not the builder. 

But it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the Postoffice is equal to it. To grope down into the bottom of the sea after them; to have one’s hands among the unspeakable foundations, ribs, and very pelvis of the world; this is a fearful thing. What am -I that I should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan! The awful tauntings in Job might well appal me. “Will he (the leviathan) make a covenant with thee? Behold the hope of him is vain!” But I have swam through libraries and sailed through oceans; I have had to do with whales with these visible hands; I am in earnest; and I will try. There are some preliminaries to settle.” (Melville and Blum, 2022, p. 201)
- Ishamel can be seen as obsessive and maniacal as Ahab himself, just as Ahab tries to hunt the whale, Ishmael has been obsessed with FINDING and CApturing the whale through all of these different scientific registers

instead of epic of antiquity - totalising view of ancient civilisation adn the world they are produced - sensibility and meaning of ancient life is expressed in every part of the epic (totalizing view of the world)
- BUT MD is profoundly fractured, shows every way of showing a truth 
	- trying out a lot of diff ways to get at the truth

is the genre of the book the failure of all these genres? 
- meta-genres --> a scholar described "a modern epic" --> incomplete and tries to use encyclopaedic range of discourses to reach a truth that doesnt exist (Ulysses, Swan's White etc.)
	- the novel itself --> omnivorous form that is continuously absorbing and metabolising other genres for its own purposes
		- MD takes and incorporates a sermon
		- Don Quiote - takes stories of chivalry but does it in an ironic way and subverts the genre for its own purposes.
- Romance
	- 
x
dynamic - genre is made up of failures of genre - is there a danger of 
- is there one way of accessing truth and the world (AHAB's dogmatic monomiacle drive)
- trying to describe romance as a genre that encompasses failure
	- are we in danger of falling back into this dogmatic world view?

first three paragraphs of Looming
- adds to a sense of ambiguity

"Call me Ishmael"
- why is it so amazing?
	- hails the reader in a particular way (breaking the fourth wall)
	- short simple sentence - length of sentence against the vastness of the book

why are they drawn to the ocean?
- Melville is uniquely attuned to the alienation experienced by people in urban (barnaby the scrivenor - "i prefer not to")
- the way Ishmael is describing the yearning of the ocean - says that everyone is feeling it but also talking about the white collar urban worker ([[Jekyll and Hyde]] professional bachelor man who is overly disciplined; [[sherlock holmes]] that is uniquely appealing)
	- repressive office work in modern societies
		- people BUT also gendered
			- battle between male writers of romance and female middle calss sentimentalists
				- romance has a very complicated relationship with the market (women are writing copies that have a lot of selling)
				- in a world where literature has become a commodity, romance is trying to extricate itself with the market but it is entangled with it.
- appeal of the ocean - breaking free of stultifying conventions that are inhibiting and alienating everyone in modern society
	- true of the genres that we are talking about --> genre as a convention that confines you from accessing the truth

"Call me Ishmael"
- can imagine more subtle and intricate
- not going to be elaborate and mannered - in the spirit of an adventurer and a Romance
- theres a certain type of unconventionality that is keeping with a sense of 

Romance
- meta-genre that begins in aristocratic culture
- defining itself against ordinary life and expeirence and realism ([[Eliot and Russell, “Middlemarch.”]])
- in conflict with each other (carried on in the 20th century)
	- if realism defines itself as inhabiting the world of the everyday
	- romance argues that ordinary is dystultification of life --> therefore need to see the extremes of life to find meaning
	- announces itself as a rejection of any inhibiting restrain whether that be the realm of restraint or regular genres
		- meaning lies behind the mask of everyday life
		- this is taken up by modernist
			- MD was lukewarm reception BUT in the 19s and 20s, then we see it as the greatest novel
			- appeal of MD for modernist is the disatisfaction of genre

literature is being mobilised in so many diff ways
- [[@arnoldArnoldCultureAnarchy1993]] --> 
- mobilising lit in service of abolition, industrial reform
- lit as popular culture
==> there wasnt a hierarchy amongst these different meanings (first half of 19th century)

but second half of 19th century
- we see hierarchy
- in victorian novel - this battle is romance vs realism


## Ahab vs Ishmael
- similarities between Ahab and Ishmael

- MD was an allegory for the dangers of totalitarianism - become enthralled to a dictator thats really bad
	- the alternative is Ishmael - figure for liberalism and open-minded acumental liberalism

 - but this reading is like disputed
	 - ultimately a character Ishmael
	 - troubling of Ahab's rise is that it was done with people's consent --> monomiacle individual but we get this erotic scene where the workers are squeezing sperm tgt
	 - ultimately everyone voted Ahab in 

- the book is interested in staging sharp contrasts between the individual and the collective; reading (extracts - usher and librarian) and adventure
	- but ultimately the book is interested in staging these opposition and bringing it in opposition with each other but not reconciling
		- Ishmael in the bed w Quezmueg - you cant truly be warm unless u r cold --> the contrast is what makes something meaningful
		- Ambergrize (stubb gets the perfume out of the rotting corpse) --> 

invested in these stark oppositions - constitutive of modern experience and modern life
