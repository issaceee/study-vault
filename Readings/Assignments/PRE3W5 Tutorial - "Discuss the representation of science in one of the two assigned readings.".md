## Thoughts

- not sure if i want to draw a distinction between science and scientific knowledge
	- Science as the field that produces scientific knowledge

if i want to talk abt how the essay is a critique on the printing culture at that time
- see how a lot of scientific writers utilise literary and narrative techniques in order to engender interest and support for their scientific theories (at a time when they were going against the current)
- but also the inverse, where writers utlilise scientific jargon and technical terms in their writing

Science as a field is not isolated, but constantly evolving alongside other fields at the time of writing, and further, that scientific knowledge is falliable and susceptible to change and discourse.
- I think this is too neutral, i think the perspective that the book takes is a little more skeptical and suspect of Science as a field and as an institution. 



In this essay, I will study the relationship between scientific writing and literary fiction, analysing specifically how both utilise aspects of the other to embellish and thus either generate interest, or lend authority to their narratives. 

- The penny press blurred the boundary between **science, fiction, and news**. Readers encountered “scientific reports” next to crime stories and hoaxes.
    
- Poe’s story was published in the _Southern Literary Messenger_ in 1835 — the _same year_ Locke’s _Moon Hoax_ appeared in the _New York Sun_.
    
- Scholars like **Carlo Martinez** [[@martinezPoesHansPfaall2011]] argue that _Hans Pfaall_ is _about_ this new media ecology: Poe satirises how **science became a kind of journalism**, produced for profit and consumed as entertainment.
    
- The “dirty-newspaper balloon” in _Hans Pfaall_ is literally made out of penny-press material — Poe turns print culture into a metaphor for science itself.


language of empirical investigation to imitate the rhetoric of truth, -- but the precision reveals the theatricality of such a performance

 -  Truth depends not on the certainty of its methods, but on the reader's willingness to believe its methods
	 - paradoxical
		 - it mocks the easy belief in the popular press and scientific journalism
		 - but at the same time, uses their methods so convincingly, sincerity and satire become indistinguishable.

In this sense, I argue that by vacillating between the two genres, Poe ultimately presents Science as both a parody and participant in this print culture. The scientific, empirical report becomes one that is fallible – a genre that must perform belief in order to sustain its claim to truth.

1. Science appear rigorous
2. But actually, this is literary in nature
3. Science is literally print [[@martinezPoesHansPfaall2011]]
4. both literature and science must believe their own fabrications to institute it into the fabric of Culture

i want one paragraph proving similarities between the outer narrative and the Pfall's narrative - by proving how both use the same techniques i want to show that the idea that the narratives always lend the same techniques - but why? in order to authenticate and lend authroity to their claims

** never having first-hand knowledge - the entire story itself is a report of the report that is in itself embelished


Hans talks about what he predicts will happen but also what happens

“I had now ascended to so vast a distance, that nothing could with accuracy be discerned.” (Poe, p. 19)

## Essay 

"Discuss the representation of _science_ in one of the two assigned readings."

At the time of publishing "The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfall" ("Hans Pfall"), antebellum American society was undergoing a print revolution marked by cheap newspapers, sensational journalism, and an increasingly international circulation of ideas. Public demonstrations of new, rapid technological advancements turned discovery into everyday spectacle, while scientific discoveries and popular scientific writing appeared alongside fiction in newly accessible newspapers and periodicals. As a result, the boundary between fact and fiction grew increasingly porous. In "Hans Pfall", Edgar Allen Poe explores this intriguing relationship, borrowing the credibility of scientific discourse by adopting its empirical, precise tone and technical vocabulary in order to parody the culture of scientific authority emerging in antebellum print culture. By overloading the text with data, citations and 'logical' deductions, Poe exaggerates the language of science into absurdity, thereby exposing its dependence on belief and spectacle rather than verifiable truth. I argue that the text operates on three interrelated narrative levels – the inner scientific report by Hans, the sensational journalistic article of the narrator, and Poe's later metafictional commentary – that each borrow and parody the conventions of empirical writing. Through their interaction, Poe reveals Science as fallible, performative discourse – a field and a genre that must perform belief and stage its own credibility in order to sustain its claim to truth. 

On the first narrative level, Poe frames Hans' letter to the authorities of Rotterdam as a scientific report, one that borrows the conventions of empirical writing to construct a facade of credibility. This inevitably fails as there is a need to sensationalise the writing in order to enhance belief and verisimilitude. Even the use of empirical, precise tone and technical vocabulary is proven to be inherently deceptive: 

"Now, the mean or average interval between the *centres* of the two planets is 59.9643 of the earth's equatorial *radii*, or only about 237,000 miles [...] the form of the moon's orbit being an ellipse of eccentricity amounting to no less than 0.05484 of the major semi-axis of the ellipse itself, [...], it was very certain that, at all events, from the 237,000 miles I would have to deduct the *radius* of the earth, say 4000, and the radius of the moon, say 1080, in all 5080, leaving an actual interval to be traversed, under average circumstances, of 231,920 miles."

The use of scientific terms here ("equatorial *radii*", "ellipse of eccentricity", "interval"), the extreme specificity of the data stated ("59.9643", "0.05484") as well as the if-then syntax of the entire paragraph, all serve to construct an image of empirical, logical deduction. There is a sense of finality and decisiveness generated from the emperical precision and confident tone of Hans that seems to portray an air of credibility and authority. This air of authority is further reinforced through the references to the Scientific field as a whole, with Hans' findings being interwoven into the various other scientific discoveries and inventions at the time. This can be seen in "M. Grimm's improvements" which "require[d] considerable alteration before it could be adapted to the purposes to which I intended making it applicable", as well as Hans stating that he "had been strengthened in my opinion by certain observations of Mr. Schroeter, of Lilienthal", among many other scientists such as M. Valz and expeditions like the "aeronautic expedition of Messieurs Gay-Lussac and Biot". These specifications serve to situate Han's discoveries within a web of scientific knowledge, especially as he improves on previous "very ingenious apparatus", bolstering and enhancing the validity of his discoveries. Yet, at the same time, these references and his discoveries seem tenuous at best. Hans' discoveries cannot be replicated. The gas that fills his balloons and the method of constructing the balloons "from the membrane of a certain animal" was communicated to him "as an important secret, by a cousin from Nantz". This gas that has "never yet [been]  by any other person than [Hans]" and the balloon made from a "certain", unnamed animal all serve to highlight a withholding of information that prevent verification. Moreover, Hans' discoveries are also dependent on contingency and accidents that prevent replication:

"left me dangling, at a terrific height [...] by a piece of slender cord [...] which hung accidentally through a crevice near the bottom of the wicker-work, and in which, as I fell, my left foot became most providentially entangled. … if I had fallen with my face turned toward the balloon… or if… the cord… had chanced to hang over the upper edge… I should have been unable to accomplish even as much as I had now accomplished, and the disclosures now made would have been utterly lost to posterity."

The very continuity of Hans' narrative, depends on a highly specific, non-repeatable configuration of chance. The fact that Hans' himself acknowledges that the discoveries would have been "utterly lost" highlights the unreproducability of his experiments. These evidences serve to highlight that the techniques employed by Hans only employ a facade of scientific inquiry and method, rather than of robustly proving the verifiability of his experiments.

Furthermore, we see some of Hans' experiments being destroyed before results could be gleaned: "an awkward accident, at this time, occasioned me the loss of my little family of cats, and deprived me of the insight into this matter which a continued experiment might have afforded". Just as Hans was about to discover insights and produce scientific knowledge, explicitly staging a live test using the cats and kittens, the experimental subject itself, the singular most important empirical data needed in the discovery is literally flung away in again a series of highly specific, non-repeatable configurations of chance: "the sleeve of my shirt became entangled in the loop which sustained the basket, and thus, in a moment, loosened it from the button". These examples demonstrate how Hans' narrative is meant to replicate a scientific report in order to claim legitimacy and authority from the scientific community, yet the methods in which the discoveries are produced and the discoveries themselves are inherently unstable and tenuous, a mere performance of empirical data and reasoning rather than a robust replication and exploration of the scientific method. Science, and scientific truth and knowledge, thus becomes more dependant on the circulation of belief, rather than method.

Yet, the genre of Hans' letter is also unstable. From the data-driven, technical-heavy jargon that characterises his report, Hans suddenly slips into poetic prose:

"Imagination, feeling herself for once unshackled, roamed at will among the ever-changing wonders of a shadowy and unstable land. Now there were hoary and timehonored forests, and craggy precipices, and waterfalls tumbling with a loud noise into abysses without a bottom [...]"

In contrast to the technical register, marked by short clauses, quantifiers, numerals, scientific jargon, if-then syntaxes, the poetic register here is marked by long periodic sentences, sensory adjectives ("ever-changing", "shadowy", "timehonored"), personification ("Imagination, feeling herself [...], roamed at will"; "waterfalls tumbling"). This juxtaposition highlights the instability of scientific discourse ("unstable land"), where the empirical voice repeatedly collapses into aesthetic fancy ("Imagination"). By letting Hans' "Imagination" literally take command of the narrative, through the active kinesthetic diction among the metaphor of scientific discourse as an "unstable land" – precarious, shifting and unable to sustain its claims to knowledge –, Poe exposes the dependence of the scientific report on the creative energies it pretends to repress. Thus, in Hans' letter, the scientific and poetic registers thus blur together, the technical language has been exaggerated so far to the point of absurdity that only the poetic can now sustain imagination and belief.

Where the first narrative level shows science as a self-parody, a text that wants to be empirical but collapses into imagination and accident, the second level presents an ideal of journalistic mediation, of the public responding to scientific spectacle. Here, Poe thus represents science not as a private pursuit but as a mediated public performance: the journalistic frame and register determines Hans' credibility through the way it presents and circulates the story. In "It was accordingly opened by those dignitaries upon the spot, and found to contain the following extraordinary, and indeed very serious, communication", science is institutionalised. There is a shift here from private empiricism to public process, where science is represented as procedurally social. This is again seen in "It appears that on the ——— day of ———, (I am not positive about the date,) a vast crowd of people…". There is an attempt here at documentary dating and evidential posturing, but the hedged parenthesis as well as the lack of specific detail undermine the certainty that journalistic writing tends to emphasize, thereby signalling the performative nature of that convention. This is mirrored in the use of "indeed, very serious", where the mocking tone of the insertion serves to undermine the credibility of the journalistic documentation of the event. Thus, by presenting science as procedurally social through the use of journalistic means, yet simultaneously, undermining the credibility of the journalistic writing, Poe highlights the instability of scientific truth when circulated among media. This is underscored in "the letter, having been published, gave rise to a variety of gossip and opinion [...] Imprimis [...] Secondly [...]". Science here is represented as a print spectacle. The scientific report, rather than giving rise to knowledge and fact, gives rise to "gossip" and "opinion". While the numbered "Imprimis", "Secondly" and so on imitates scientific order, it merely recirculates and repeats gossip ("Let us see what they say"). Science is thus represented as being not only represented by a circulation of beliefs, but that these beliefs are inherently shaped by the print culture of the time and therefore undermined in their factual credibility.

In fact, "see[ing] what they say" is precisely the agenda of print culture – commercial, rhetorical and social. It determines what is noticed, how it is shaped and whose authority is preserved. The outer narrator's mock-serious, hyperbolic tone both mimics and mocks the sensationalism of popular journalism, highlighting the preference of emotionally affective reporting over factual scrutiny. In "so completely unexpected so entirely novel — so utterly at variance with preconceived opinions — as to leave no doubt on my mind that long ere this all Europe is in an uproar, all physics in a ferment, all reason and astronomy together by the ears." The hyperbolic escalation here ("so completely unexpected [...] so entirely novel [....] so utterly at variance") performs an escalating uproar that produces rumor as evidence. The appeal to exclusivity in "I have it on the best authority, of the precise material which no one had ever before known to be used for a similar purpose” engenders a sense of privileged access in the reader – the thrill of being privy to secret (and scientific) knowledge. Yet, this knowledge is inseparable with theopinions of the narrator: "For my part, I cannot conceive upon what data they have founded such an accusation"; "to say the least of the matter, not a whit better, nor greater, nor wiser than they ought to be." By shaping the reader's suspense and excitement, while imbuing the journalistic article with the personal opinion, the narrative collapses reportage into rhetoric. Authority is performed through feeling, not fact – the tone itself becomes the mode of persuasion. On the second level of narration, Poe therefore not only represents scientific knowledge as being circulated and thus shaped by print culture, but exposes the inherent incompatibility between the objectivity of Science and the subjective economies of print culture and journalism.

Having shown the need for Science to perform spectacle in order to generate belief, Poe's third narrative frame thus pulls back the curtain in his own voice, implicating author, reader, and press in the production of truth. Poe's authorial intrusions make explicit that science is produced by publication, clearly highlighting the economies of truth and belief in a dynamic print culture dependant on audience engagement and the performance of belief. Added after the publishing of the Great Moon Hoax by Locke, Poe explained that his original piece was not intended to be a serious hoax. By actively distancing himself from hoaxing ()"one is in a tone of banter, the other of downright earnest"), Poe himself performs the role of editor and publisher and modulates reader's response – explicitly telling readers how to interpret his narrative. Crucially, Poe does so with the same techniques used in the previous narrative levels: comparison and enumerated parallels. By hihglighting similarities and differencies between his tale and contemporary hoaxes, Poe fashions a justification that is itself performative. 

In all three narrative frames of the novel, across Hans' scientific report, the journalistic article and Poe's authorial footnotes, print culture is always negotiable. It is authorship, editorial framing and a performance of belief that shape what the public considers scientific knowledge. Science is that a performative genre – its authority is secured through staged credibility and the circulation of belief rather than by the scientific method and empirical inquiry alone.


3rd level (meta-fictional note)


meta level:
- names are entirely ironing
	- Von Underduk and Rubadub


- a criticism of print culture
	- “If a fire wanted fanning, it could readily be fanned with a newspaper; and as the government grew weaker, I have no doubt that leather and iron acquired durability in proportion” (Poe, p. 3)










---
Notably, the text operates on 3 levels: the narrative of Hans Pfall addressed to the authorities of Rotterdam, the narrator commenting on Hans' story, as well as Poe's later additions to the text that comment on the text itself. On all three levels, I argue that the narratives lend techniques from both scientific writing and sensationalist literature, at once lending authority to their claims by imbuing the text with a sense of empirical methodology, but at the same time, blurring fact and fiction, engendering suspicion in the reader and characters regarding the various veracity of the various narratives. In doing so, the reader vascillates between trust and suspicion, thereby portraying Science as a performative discourse: not simply a body of empirical facts, but a mode of public persuasion that is as dependant on the circulation of facts and belief as method.





# Tutorial Notes

## Hans Phall

- My ancestors have also resided therein time out of mind — they, as well as myself, steadily following the respectable and indeed lucrative profession of mending of bellows: for, to speak the truth, until of late years, that the heads of all the people have been set agog with politics, no better business than my own could an honest citizen of Rotterdam either desire or deserve. Credit was good, employment was never wanting, and there was no lack of either money or good will. [page 6:] But, as I was saying, we soon began to feel the effects of liberty, and long speeches, and radicalism, and all that sort of thing. People who were formerly the very best customers in the world, had now not a moment of time to think of us at all. They had as much as they could do to read about the revolutions, and keep up with the march of intellect and the spirit of the age. If a fire wanted fanning, it could readily be fanned with a newspaper; and as the government grew weaker, I have no doubt that leather and iron acquired durability in proportion — for, in a very short time, there was not a pair of bellows in all Rotterdam that ever stood in need of a stitch or required the assistance of a hammer. This was a state of things not to be endured. I soon grew as poor as a rat, and, having a wife and children to provide for, my burdens at length became intolerable, and I spent hour after hour in reflecting upon the most convenient method of putting an end to my life. Duns, in the meantime, left me little leisure for contemplation. My house was literally besieged from morning till night. There were three fellows in particular, who worried me beyond endurance, keeping watch continually about my door, and threatening me with the law. Upon these three I vowed the bitterest revenge, if ever I should be so happy as to get them within my clutches; and I believe nothing in the world but the pleasure of this anticipation prevented me from putting my plan of suicide into immediate execution, by blowing my brains out with a blunderbuss. I thought it best, however, to dissemble my wrath, and to treat them with promises and fair words, until, by some good turn of fate, an opportunity of vengeance should be afforded me.
	- parody of scientific discourse

I revolved carefully over in my memory the wild and sometimes unintelligible reasonings of the writer. There were [[are]] some particular passages which affected my imagination in an extraordinary manner. The longer I meditated upon these, the more intense grew the interest which had been excited within me. The limited nature of my education in general, and more especially my ignorance on subjects connected with natural philosophy, so far from rendering me diffident of my own ability to comprehend what I had read, or inducing me to mistrust the many vague notions which had arisen in consequence, merely served as a farther stimulus to imagination; and I was vain enough, or perhaps reasonable enough, to doubt whether those crude ideas which, arising in ill-regulated minds, have all the appearance, may not often in effect possess all [[also]] the force, the reality, and other inherent properties of instinct or intuition.
- a connection between literature and science
- so completely enthralled
- science being completely as absurd as fiction

- Hans Phall didnt actually know that much science
	- gets enough of it to inspire his imagination
	- engages with it in such a creative way that it becomes reality it becomes truth

can read whats going about science, in the same way that we read the political climate
- all these forces that oppresses Phall, he uses them to enable his journey to 

moon hoax - the power of the press, sensational turn in American journalism culture
- the stuff they're discovering in the moon is much more racialised 

- Poe is interested in the hoax as a phenomenon

print culture - making people who have a strict local or regional orientation - giving them access to what is happening, salience of racial other, now for the first time you are reading reports of people travelling to each other


## Jekyll
- the victorian gentleman

- why is the novel focused around a bunch of bachelor dudes
	- framing of science as a jocky, masculine way
	- weaponising science?


- gendered but also, class/professional element
	- men who are supposed to be disciplined (Dr. Jekyll vs Mr. Hyde) - looking at the juxtaposition btw the titles. 
		- mental work, the repressive controlled lifestyle (deny immediate desires and funnel them into work that makes them more susceptible into having an ugly underside)
	- emergence of a class of professionals - 20th century anglophone moment - 1890s (US) industrial society evolves to a place called corporate capitalism - large vertically integrated company (mental workers that get such pleasure at reading Holmes)
		- psychodynamics of that professional classs

- why is the book narrated by utterson, why is it structured as a kind of mystery?
	- tapping into things that are deliberately veiled wihtin society
	- narrator being a man who has nothing immoral going on
	- inhabiting the realm of the gothic before we get to the big transofrmational



Caroline Levine - The Serious Pleasures of Suspense
- account of realism that tries to link realist fiction with emergent forms of scientific experimentation
- Zola as believing that literature can create scientific knowledge - naturalism as a literary genre that generates  scientifc knowledge

**lightman reading 19th cnetury
- religion, science, culture --> all of these categories overlap alot that are also working harmoniously of the Anglican frameworks of the 19th century

- but these endeavours start separating from each other 
- literature or culture cant be disentangled from the secular/non-secular scientists (both are mobilising literature) 
- but beginning of 20th century, we have science and literature as autonomous filed (per sociologists)

==> scientific writing that exists in literary journal --> if you can read great work of literature, you can read a great piece of science


scientific authority
- at that point of time, it was a very contested genre, scientific authority and literary production were vying with each other for cultural authority

- both a warning about the dangers of science and scientific knowledge run amuck but at the same time also internalising a lot of Darwinism science
	- Hyde - base instincts --> primal,uncivilised Other (//imperial ideology)
