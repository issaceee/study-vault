Douglass as utilising literature to undermine and fight against slavery peculiar institution of the US


page 29:
- introspective 
- doesnt come off as he is not resentful
- he is not really learning to read
- values that he is learning is in the process of negation - learns the value because he is being denied of that experience
	- sense of reading associated with humanity and capacity for introspection - literacy becomes sort of a tool to understand and misery/fix it and ameliorate it 

what is this doing for the reader?
- gravity of words - understanding the magnitude of words are 
- become more aware of the use of language 
- universalising impulse behind this scene of reading pedagogy - if the racist discourse antebellums - unhumanity of the slaves is intself proof of a shared humanity across racial divisions 

1st paragraph:
- lack of temporrality - suspended in the same perpetuality that he must have felt while being a slave
- dehumanising - to not know of the birthday
	- measuring time through seasons - 
	- suggests a kind of distortion of the family - ideology of sentimantalism emerges out of the space at the home and the women of the home - rewrote about this narrative 10 years later and emphasised more of the role of his mom and her experiences - calling attention to the way that the slave trade prevents family's from knowing each other 
- in the tradition - people would question the authenticity of the novel - how could a writing so good be part of the slave [[@gouldRiseDevelopmentCirculation2007]] - so why does he start with the fact that he doesnt know his age


tradition of slave narrative and mixture of genres
- how does the genre of this novel challenge/fit in with the other genres
	- autobiography - narrate creation and self-discovery from ntohing
		- Douglass can make a claim for self-creation in a way thats seems more fulfilling to the autobiography rather than other autobiographies?


rigorous and detailed description of how the slave system works
- showing how corporate plantation structures work (// MArx's capitalist volume 1); give detials of how the slave system works 

- writing and reading is not that good 
	- recognition that he learns form being denied literacy - literacy as a very powerful tool - access to literature creates power imbalances, fundamentally an instrument of power
	- possibility that just because language and literacy is one of the amster's tools doesnt mean that its not one of the tools can be used to destroy the master's house
	- part of how literature is working as an instrument of power is through publicity and making people aware of political realities - publicity tt D is trying to avoid by preventing 

prefaces:
- a series of white privilege is constructing the way for Douglass to enter the world of print and publication
	- in the 2econd autobiography, he says that the white leaders of the abolitionist shapes the way that he tells his story
	- his critique is that the white people wld just tell him what to say, hes only there as evidence not as a leader
		- even at his most autonomous, he is still grappled
	- rewriting his autobiography is a way for him to reclaim his story and narrative
	- also got his own printing press
- also how the enslaved people cannot serve as witnesses SO the prefaces are like the authority needed

- the novel as an instument of Douglass' oppression but also liberation 

- why focus on his speech?
	- emphasizing that in this moment in media history, oratory is a big part of political culture (he learns from the Columbian Orator)
	- its interesting because its not written - the embodied performance of DOuglass' narrative in a non-written media

3. an attempt to reinvigorate literature by trying to embed the sonic capability by trying to embed the sorrow songs into literature

---
Uncle Tom's Cabin

- written after the fugitive slave law
	- 

- universalises & collective / relatable into the narrative
- universal principle that we are all the same
	- Douglass can read and write
	- Motherhood here is working across national boundaries 

- use of the river - one side of the river, slavery is legal, the other is not ()
	- river as a boundary between a fragmented US
	- when these slavehunters trespass into the north - markuing a boundary but also not as a boundary

- action sequence
	- long standing depiction of critique of race because all its black characters are caricatures, even though it did play a role in the abolitionist form it has a complicated relationship because it has a bunch of racial caricatures
	- some scholars try to reconcile this by trying to bring in biblical plan 
	- action sequence appeals to a felt experience --> play on the readers emotions in order to reporgram their thoughts and feelings on slavery
		- stowe says "feel the right way" quote
	- written in media culture of theatrical tradition, coincides with other bad other racial policies
		- eliza episode is famously replayed again and again in minstrel shows --> becomes a performance of racial inferiority
		- Beatrice Stowe writes such a dramatic and power scene that she imagines its political power being realised through its being replayed back and back again (even in chap 8 - even characters in the boook renarrates the scene - culture replays it again and again and it continues to grow and change people's mind)
