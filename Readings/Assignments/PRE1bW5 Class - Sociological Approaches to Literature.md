why was this considered the most important piece of literary writing at the time it was published
- published in the new yorker
- making a big argument that creative writing arguments are good - a lot of writers in the US thought that the creative writing programs create hegemony
	- can creative writing be taught?
- you can do this sort of programatically style of analysis on literature across many other genres


* *
- working at a level above the author
	- "The pound era"




- how different methods/theories gain dominance at a specific point of time, is by accusing/pointing out the flaws of the previouslyd dominant theory

need tot ake note of the various levels of abstractions that a literary theorist might take
- sociological abstractions take the middle - in between high level of abstractions (globalization etc) or super minute (close reading)
	- i dont think that there needs to be a super strict binary but more dialectic
	- 


- why use Nabokov?
	- bad example - but even though hes a bad example, he still fits within....

	- rise of creative writing program - self-consciousness that 




[[PRE1bW4 Seminar - Aesthetics]] - Mcgurl is clearly making aesthetic judgments and arguments within this book

post-war literature
- a lot of terms were being thrown around
	- postmodernism
	- multi-ethnic - minimalism - new yorker that didnt appear to be too experimental
- the text gave a lot of poeple a way to describe a lot of things happening at once


## The Index
- theres a division between story and plot,
- bathos 
- manipian satire (?)


- mechanics of how this works
	- a diligent reader can construct a story out of the 
		- there are gestures made towards traditional narrative structures
			- Avignon entries... 

- painting of sexually active conquests
- playing on the diea that he can affect a bunch of - myth of the "great man in history"
	- satirizing that myth

implication of the excess of the connections
- if its a satire also makes it a lot more humorous...

- imply - margins of history,, 
	- referring to something that doesn't exit
		- something thats supposed to organise - a reference document where the thing that it refers to is absent

* chronology is violated 
	* but at the same time there is a sense of linearity even if there is no linearity
	* how is it meant to be read/organised?
		* if we read it as a traditional story
			* the story culminates wiht him trying to use the religious movement to overthrow the UN and start a war on the US
		* historical markers to locate us in a particular marker in the cold war


how do we treat it as a work of:

1. NH 
	- in terms of time, away from linear narratives - a bunch of smlal narratives that make a meta-narrative
	- calls attention to the way that it makes one person reads
		- makes u into a close reader - there is no story wihtout close reading into the index
	- reaching out into different historical suggestions
	- **it looks very radical to read it as a satirical of the great man of history** --> but we are no longer naive enough to manipulate history
		- it looks like a radical and clever argument, but it is entirely keeping with postmodernist aesthetics that there is no referend, its just texts

2. Aestheticism
	- [[ingaiinteresting]] - interesting elicits a kind of bigger discussion and sicourse --> render subjective aesthetive experience, in the more objective terms that produces a good thing
	- broadening a sense of what can be included in our aesthetic experience
	- produces satisfaction, patterning of an index and the subversion of the patterning
		- giving u that experience of constructing patterns but also making you aware of the processes in your own head that is enabling that specific behaviour

3. highest abstraction
	- devolution of literary text, economy Jameson - Postmodernism (everything has been commodified)
	- 

4. Close Reading
	- 

5. Sociological
	-  why is it so hard to view it through a sociological lens?
		- vague terms - English
			- interaction with social - it cld apply to every methodology
	- one approach wld be to track down the readers (past and now) reactions - describe the meaning and power through the reaction
	- you could analyse the story in the particular context of the publishing industry in the 1970s - original occured in experimental magazine 'Bananas' - lasted 5 years before peteing out
		- one of the editors said Emma Tenent: "simply reflex the commercialisation that has taken out everywhere... has triumphed... theres such a wide choice of products... "
		- avant garde experimental publishing gets harder and harder to exist in a world where commercial pressures drown out the small presses
			- empitiness of HRH, may not describing human condition but describing the experience of an experimental writer who feels powerless in a publishing industry taken over by commercialisation
