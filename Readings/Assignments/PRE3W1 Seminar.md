[[@arnoldArnoldCultureAnarchy1993]] speaks of a big C Culture in the 19th century, that transforms into a anthropological culture in the 20th century, from a stratified, hierarchical structure into a horizontally, equal organised structure.

>So Culture has a rough task to achieve in this country. Its preachers have, and are likely long to have, a hard time of it, and they will much oftener be regarded, for a great while to come, as elegant or spurious Jeremiahs than as friends and benefactors. That, however, will not prevent their doing in the end good service if they persevere. And, meanwhile, the mode of action they have to pursue, and the sort of habits they must fight against, ought to be made quite clear for every one to see, who may be willing to look at the matter attentively and dispassionately.

>Faith in machinery is, I said, our besetting danger; often in machinery most absurdly disproportioned to the end which this machinery, if it is to do any good at all, is to serve; but always in machinery, as if it had a value in and for itself. What is freedom but machinery? what is population but machinery? what is coal but machinery? what are railroads but machinery? what is wealth but machinery? what are, even, religious organisations but machinery?
- He associates machinery more with the rise of new industrialists rather than the aristocrats --> treating things as a means to an end
- Finds the dissenting religious traditions part of this middle classs 

- Working class as an Embryo (pg. 97)
	- Arnold associates the working class with anarchy and the opening up of new freedoms is what generates the anarchy that scares Arnold

> Now, if culture, which simply means trying to perfect oneself, and one's mind as part of oneself, brings us light, and if light shows us that there is nothing so very blessed in merely doing as one likes, that the worship of the mere freedom to do as one likes is worship of machinery, that the really blessed thing is to like what right reason ordains, and to follow her authority, then we have got a practical benefit out of culture. We have got a much wanted principle, a principle of authority, to counteract the tendency to anarchy which seems to be threatening us.
- Culture is the response to the demands of the working classs

[[@williamsCultureSociety178019501960]] 
The aristocracy  (Barbarians) were, as a class, useless, because their char acteristic virtues were those created by the business of de  fending the status quo. Their very vigour in this defence  made them inaccessible to the free play of new ideas, on  which light and authority' must depend. The middle classes (Philistines) were also useless, because of their at  tachment to an external civilization. Their faith in 'machin  ery' (Wealth, Industry, Production, Progress) and in in dividual success denied, respectively, the ^harmonious* and  the 'general* pursuit of perfection. As for the working classes (Populace), they either shared with the middle classes the  attachment to external civilization, wishing only to become  Philistine as quickly as possible; or else they were merely degraded and brutal,

rendering of sorrow songs on a notation form -> transformation into a different form --> but also continues/reflects this interplay between the culture

Sorrow Song: a diologue/inter-mixing between white and black culture (story of back and forth btw white and black, between oral and textual) --> demonstrate the importance and salience of african-american culture to American community
