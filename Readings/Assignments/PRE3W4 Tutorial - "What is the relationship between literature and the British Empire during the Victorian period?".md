## White Man's Burden

casting the people who benefit as victims and the victims as beneficiaries -- victimising the victors

form of the poem that makes it so resonant to the 19th century

- vernacular forms that are unwritten (associated more with folk culture) - Kipling wrote it for the music hall - proto-meme that can be passed around and invoked


Poem's structures and forms as representing the civility/civilised form
- regularity as the form of the poem

The ports ye shall not enter, The roads ye shall not tread, Go make them with your living, And mark them with your dead!
- infrastructure that he is talking to the colonisers
- imposed regularity - task that white british men need to perform

man vs woman
- erasure of the feminine
	- while the white man presents himself as superior
- process of ageing is mapped into the poem
	- indigenous people are presented as half devil and half child
	- assume adulthood by becoming an imperial power
		- last stanza
- gender as something that cuts across the colonized/colonizer relationship - to be an adult is to be a man, and to be a man is to be an adult --> indigenous is denied access to gender (child, peoples) --> sexless children and adults in the room is white british men who have people's good in mind
	- militaristic air --> earn ur manhood if u join
- vision of masculinity
	- part of it is being unliked --> part of being a man and an adult as being not liked and doint it anyway because its for everyones good
- "Take up the White Man's burden"
	- imploring, memorable
	- commanding --> speaker as a place in authority --> propaganda we often think as subtle but this is quite outward
	- enjoining readers to do something that benefits them already 


late victorian period --> industrialisation period --> more and more of the population is white collar and professionals --> world becomes less real because they dont till the land --> subject to bearacrizing forces that they see as emasculising --> military adventure becomes a way of reasserting manhood 


## The Adventure of the Speckled Band

- the locked door mysteries
	- why do we enjoy it so much?
		- because the crimes are contained, it engages a some form of 
	- can we really solve the mysteries?

- why Watson
	- works as an inroad into the narrator
	- narrative element to it - Holme's is this genius and we can't get direct access to this mind because hes so far about our mortal mind's

interesting oscillation between feeling smart (participating in the solutions to the impossible mysteries) and feeling dumb (being next to such a genius)

"nobody is as smart as holmes, but nobody is as dumb as watsons" - narrative and plot and suspense --> the way theres a delay is because watsons is never noticing the right things

how does all of this realte to the imperial drama?
 - what looks to be a self-contained world --> inevitably theres a way in to the locked-door room --> there needs to be some leakage between the outdoors and indoors
 - connecting the domestic space of Britain to its farthest colonies (confined in the room, basic unit of enclosure in british life TO the sprawling empire, at the farthest reachest of the room is where the murder happens)

sense in whihc the colonial enterprise has the corrupting effect on the people on the metropole
- "viole"

scholars tend to treat detective genre as a conservative era --> imposes a satisying order on it

- Kipling's leakages? overcompensation --> if it was such an obvious/common-sense underatking then it doesnt need such a great and powerful message
	- impulse to say imperialism is racist, therefore anti-imperialism is not-racist (in us - antiimperialist are racist, they see encounters in the colonies as racially contaminating, even if benefitting from it materially, theres a strain of anti-imperialism, contatct with non-whites is bad for white people)





# Own Notes

"It is possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth."
- to note that truth was hidden until death of victim + the purpose of releasing the text (within the novel) is to quell "widespread rumours [...] which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth.
- yet the reason for secrecy is NOT revealed to the reader


characterisation of holmes: "the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him."

secondary victims of empire: 
- her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard.
- Sir, I can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues.
- the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman
	- the horror and terror come from uncertainty and from seemingly distant points that altogether serve to affect Helen (maybe could possibly mirror all of the various effects of colonialism that seem so distant yet when come together present an extremely troubling view of Victorian society? - New Historicism? [[PRE1bW3 Seminar New Historicism]][[@gallagherPracticingNewHistoricism]])
	- "depend so entirely upon small points which might seem trivial to another"


notion of money
- At present it is out of my power to reward you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful.”
- She had a considerable sum of money—not less than £ 1000 a year—and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage.
- The money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.
- It is evident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent.
	- sense of monetary independance?
	- NOTE that actually the man is completely dependant on his relation to the woman for his spoils - it is not in anyway from his medical practices in India - the only thing is that he got married WHILE in indea - does this say anyth abt colonialism - maybe like how the spoils isnt necessary in the violence committed?
		- In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was in little better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided.
			- he is enjoying but not really enjoying the spoils of his colonial


weird/interesting things to note:
- Farintosh,” said he. “Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with an opal tiara
	- interesting that the story is never expanded upon BUT that it has to do with an "opal tiara" - sentiments of spoils of colonialism
- I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied.
	- not sure what to make of this, but its quite interesting because it was actually stated at the end that the Dr has been letting the snake in for multiple days prior to the day of the death

the project of colonialism:
- “The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he established a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man.
	- seeking of wealth/escaping terror in the home , Dr Roylott served to find wealth and prosperity in India, successfully in face "established a large practice"
	- BUT there is semblance of anger and violence within the excursion, both onto him and him onto others --> resulted in a changed man "returned to England a morose and disappointed man"

the idea of "a changed man"
- he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path
- Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in my stepfather’s case it had, I believe, been intensified by his long residence in the tropics.
	- super interesting! violence is intrinsic, yet it has been intensified by the empire's conquest
- ntil at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.
- "For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor’s knee. Five little livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.  “You have been cruelly used,” said Holmes."
	- violence among family (but also note that they are not really family - only in step-relation)
- "He is a hard man,” she said, “and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.”"
- "The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the Doctor’s voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him."

- in [[@siddiqiCESSPOOLEMPIRESHERLOCK2006]], it is argued that the returned colonial man, returns as either a respectable colonialists who re-seed imperialist and capitalist structure from their colonial spoils OR as the lumpen/poor-whites of which the empire tries to subjugate but at the same time needs, yet are embarassed of for the very presence of these people subvert the narrative paitned of imperialism
- in "The Adventure of the Speckled Band", the character of Dr Roylott, embodies Both! (my argument)
	- can be seen here: "His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand", "seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey."
		- the idea in siddiqi about the bodily change - "burned, seared, marked" from hsit time in India?


minorities/sentiments of the 'indian' exotic:
- He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master.
	- also take note of the idea that
	- i also find the idea of "always""locking the door" very interesting - "Doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.”"
		- there seems to be a very explicit attempt to separate the outdoors/India (gypsies, indian exotic animals) with that of indoors/the civilised 
		- yet noting that there is an unseen pathway/connection that is itself fraught with various metaphors ([[@hennessyConstructionWomanThree1989]] argues the murder is staged as a "symbolic rape" - "Roylott kills Julia by means of a poisonous snake sent through a vent connecting his bedroom to hers) the narrative dramatizes the sexual economy of patriarchy")
			- "the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed."
- It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.’ - diction of wrteched highlights the victorian views of india
- was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows.
	- interesting to note the description of the night at the time of death - seems to elicit a sense of wildness and nature, uncontrolabillity? // to the idea of the underdeveloped and uncivilised India? 
	- // "From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall."
		- again the idea of nature and the silence of civilisation/distance
- Making our way among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.
	- “That is the baboon.” - slavery
- Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers.
	- on death he is wearing "Turkish slippers"
- "The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training"
	- "easetern training"

### Form and the Mystery

Clues
- "There is no communication between them," + "for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke."
- It was the band! The speckled band!
	- symbolism of the band - the fact that the snake itself was a band + the red herring of the "band of gypsies" but that in itself the snake itself fulfills this clue - being wrapped around Dr Roylett's head as a band
		- "sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used."
		- "Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion."
- "No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is"
- "what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!”"
- "What’s in here?” he asked, tapping the safe.  “My stepfather’s business papers"
- The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope—or so we may call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.
- "a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle" - "I heard the creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the light and attacked it.”"


- I see many objections to any such theory.”  “And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal, or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of the devil!”
	- the need for further inquiry - note the original suspicion on the gipsies
- “I had,” said he, “come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data.
- The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word ‘band,’ which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent


The Detective form
- "am a dangerous man to fall foul of! See here.” He stepped swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.  “See that you keep yourself out of my grip,” he snarled, and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.  “He seems a very amiable person,” said Holmes, laughing. “I am not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own.” As he spoke he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again."
	- Sherlock's symbolic straigtening out of the steel poker symbolises the solving of the clues - sense of righting wrongs/something that is amiss
- "it’s a wicked world, and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all.", "I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,", "“I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.”"
	- Sherlock solves the crime in that he identifies the crux of the murder, but not the means , yet Doyle does not let the audience know of the revelations - why?
- “You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me.”  “No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that you saw all that I did.”
	- Seeing vs deducing - analysing and looking deeper into the text is important - DOyle asking us to look deeper?
- But I saw nothing.
- ""


******* Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge.


resolution/repercussions
- when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.
	- the repercussions of upsetting empire
- "And perhaps, after all, it is for the best"
- "the deadliest snake in India. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened."
- "An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained."
- "Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott’s death, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience."
	- a commentary on how the reader is supposed to feel upon fighting back

### My questions to answer in the essay:

- is Doyles arguing against or for imperialism here
	- I think it is quite clear that it is against


- i think its quite clear that the literature that Doyle is writing is much affected/in response to the Colonial excursions operated by the British
	- underlying fears of the Victorians during this period of their role in the colonial expansion of British? - how people return changed where it is truly a good thing or not
- but i think another interesting thing would be to look at how the EMPIRE is affected by the literature of that time
	- i want to look at critical reviews of the book
		- was seen as one of the best both by readers and by sherlock - what exactly about the novel made it so receptive by readers
	- but also i want to look at the form of the book - the 
		- the rise of popular culture led to the birth of this detective fiction which in term promulgated the middle/lower class with ideas and beliefs previously only held/accessible to the elites (increase in education and publication)
		- the short story, detective format was meant to engage the victorian readers of that time - does the story affect the empire in any way?


# "What is the relationship between literature and the British Empire during the Victorian period?"

In the late nineteenth century, Victorian society was marked by rapid change and destabilisation. The turn of the century was rife with both confidence and fear: Victorians were riding the high-tide of New Imperialism, while fin-de-siècle anxieties regarding society, the home and the individual were gaining steam. It was in this period where English literary culture exploded in range and reach, due to industrial print, rising literacy and imperial expansion. It is in this context where the relationship between literature and the British Empire becomes fraught, each shaping the other. I argue that the relationship between literature and the British Empire is bi-directional, encoded most clearly in literary form. While the Empire's conquests shape literature's exploration of various new forms, that being in this essay the emerging imperialist detective fiction seen in “The Adventure of the Speckled Band”, to tackle contemporary anxieties, these anxieties often persist within the texts as leakages. That is, literature acts as both collaborator and quiet resistor to the Empire: the genre is shaped by imperial power in its promise of logical reasoning and neat closures, yet, the very forms that promise order leak anxiety, exposing fears of empire’s violence as intimate and internal.

  

Detective fiction in Victorian literature promised closure and domestic sanctity by encoding the need for structure and order within its neat, logical form amid degeneration anxieties at a fin-de-siècle moment. However, the genre, which trains procedures of detection and logical reasoning, possesses leakages which lead to readers getting a lesson in not just deduction, but skepticism regarding the text and empire as well. In “The Adventure of the Speckled Band", Holmes states that he "wants to see whether the objections are fatal, or if they may be explained away". The text stages a dichotomy that presents anxieties as either grounded in reality and therefore "fatal" to civilization, or fears unfounded, therefore being able to be "explained away". Here, Doyle privileges the role of logical deduction and fact-finding: "I had [...] come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data”. The diction of "always"  and "entirely" present an insistent, predetermined outcome of danger and error from "insufficient data". Doyle therefore privileges the act of fact-finding, with "data" perhaps reflecting the multitudes of literary texts emerging during the period that sought not just to reflect reality, but explore its nuances. The detective genre thus trains readers to speculate and deduce logically. The genre itself also features tidy endings, a neat closure to the mysterious crime at hand. In this case, it serves to reassure readers of closed loops and resolved fears. 

  

More than just logical deduction, the genre also upholds domestic sanctity, a result of writers grappling with their anxieties regarding the corruption of the British Empire. The story is freighted with sentiments of the Indian exotic, framing them as an Other that is kept separated and outside from British society. In both Julia's death scene and the near-murder of Helen, there is use of pathetic fallacy to frame the exotic as Other and Outdoors, compared to the domestic sanctity of the Civilised Indoors: 

  

"It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows"; "From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they seemed, those quarters!" 

  

The use of "wild" and the personification of the wind and rain with "howling" and "beating" present an animalistic external threat to the domestic. Further, the juxtaposition between the "occasional cry of a night-bird" and the "long drawn catlike whine" against the "deep tones of the parish clock", extend the dichotomy temporally – unruly, unhuman and unregular against the civic, communal and disciplined. Notably, the murder 'weapon' is of Indian descent, a Swamp Adder that is part of Dr Roylott's "passion [...] for Indian animals, which are sent over to him". The very fact that the direct accessory of the murder is an Indian import seems to portray not only the exotic as Other, but as dangerous. 

  

Yet this staged binary is itself unstable – the outside leaks indoors, and the dichotomy collapses, reflecting a tense relationship exposed in its leakages. The empire compels reassurance, yet literature's slips expose what this forced reassurance cannot contain. In the description of the externalised exotic threat, we see a slowed perception of civil time: "How long they seemed, those quarters!". In the face of fear and terror of the Other, time slips precisely where reassurance should hold, thereby demonstrating leakages in the promised safety of the home. Moreover, the perceived safe space of the home is also invaded. The imported cheetah and baboon threaten the safety of its occupants: "the Doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked". The outdoors seems to control the home. In fact, this is seen in the state of the house itself – there is a clear demarcation between the ruined section of the home, and the civilised, domesticated section:

  

In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards, [...] a picture of ruin [...] but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the windows [...] showed that this was where the family resided.

  

Here we see a direct shift from the inability to see, to controlled visibility. The genre encourages us to "look in" through windows for clues, yet crucially, the crime depends on a clue that has not yet been revealed: a ventilator between rooms whose visibility is managed. Notably, the crime occurs in this modern space rather than the expected site of ruin, hinted in the diction of "comparatively" which acts as a hedge to undercut the decisive comparison. Modernity and civilisation here appears partial and precarious, and locating the crime in this space, or more particularly, furnishing the crime and mechanisms of harm with "improvements" and "renovations" meant to heighten this false sense of modernity, creates a fragile facade of safety in the very space that engineers danger. These 'improvements' are deliberate, infrastructural and unchangeable: the ventilator "open[s]  into another room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air", the dummy bell hook is "fastened [...] just above where the little opening for the ventilator is", and the bed "must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope”. This is further reinforced by the detail of both Julia and Helen "lock[ing]" themselves in their rooms. They themselves fall victim to this reassurance of safety, finding themselves instead in the direct path of danger. This reflects the tension between imperial spoils and the privileges of Victorian society – even as the Empire furnishes the house, its 'improvements' channel risk, harm and violence. It also hints to readers to look beyond external, obvious clues, training skepticism in their analysis of the case, and the text.

  

This is seen in the characterisation of Dr Roylott. Yumna Siddiqi argues that Doyle portrays returned colonialists either as the "respectable colonial" or his "undesirable double: the imperial lumpenproletarian" (238). In this story however, these two characters collapse into one body, where Roylott is framed as a failed respectability. Dr Roylott claims the signs of the respectable colonial in the claiming of the ancestral seat of the mansion, his professional title that mimics gentility, and his "comparatively modern” renovations, an echo of Siddiqi’s respectable colonial that reinvigorates society with his colonial spoils. Yet, he practised the “imperial lumpenproletarian”, leaning towards an Indian exoticness: "He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies, [...], and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them". The murder is also attributed to Roylott's "eastern training": "The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training". Crucially, however, the murder is not the effect of foreign contagion, as much as the text misdirects it to be, but of English greed.  The text grounds the violence in English domestic structures, that being inheritance and patriarchy: "if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a mere pittance". Roylott's criminality is thus activated by metropolitan incentives. Moreover, while the murder weapon is of Indian descent, and backed by an "Eastern training", the mechanics for the murder are his "comparatively modern” improvements (the rope, bed, vent and safe) that are part of his performance of respectability.  The two types of returned colonialists collapse in Roylott not because he is both, but because respectability is a veneer. In both cases of the home and Rowlott, the text trains readers to misread the threat at exterior and exotic, even as the murder mechanism is entirely domestic. What looks like external colonial taint is actually, the pressure of the inheritance and empire doing their quiet work indoors. 

  

This is again seen in the titular symbol of the "Speckled Band". The speckled band first functions as a misdirection, then as a revelation. The text initially trains readers to seek an external culprit (the gipsie's "spotted handkerchiefs", the "deadliest snake in India"), yet the revelation exposes domestic and internal conduits. It is Dr Roylott that actively "trained" the snake. In the end, the "Speckled Band" is literalised when the snake coils back upon Roylott's head. The spoils of the Empire crowns and kills its master. We thus see how the text inculcates outward and external suspicion, yet at the same time, pushes for skepticism towards that very reflex, revealing how the domestic actually channels harm from within. 

  

Interestingly, Rosemary Hennessy posits that the murder is staged as a "symbolic rape (Roylott kills Julia by means of a poisonous snake sent through a vent connecting his bedroom to hers)" (329). Viewed through this lens, the incestuous nature of this murder also symbolises something more corrupt that festers from within the Family of the Empire, rather than as an external threat. Thus, imperial aggression is framed as intimate, inherent and domestic. 

  

However, Doyle's closure is ethically uneasy rather than neat. Order is restored not by law and deductive reasoning, but by a death Holmes precipitates and for which, he is largely unrepentant. Holme’s reflection that "perhaps, after all, it is for the best [...]  I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience" turns his exclamation that "Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent", into a cycle rather than a cure. While Holmes prevents further harm, demonstrating the text’s positioning of retribution as poetic justice, this very positioning displaces legal justice and procedure, of which the detective genre outwardly privileges and practices. Official inquiry into the murder smoothes over the messy truth of Holmes’ intervention and Roylott’s crime: he “met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet”. The contrast of law’s absence with the story’s insistence (and performance) of procedure, forces the reader to accept the ending as a neat closure despite knowing the messy truth. This therefore demonstrates the genre’s attempt to naturalise imperial authority, “explain[ing it] away”, offering superficial closures to mysteries, yet simultaneously revealing instability of that authority and fragility of these closures in their contradiction against the very essence of its genre.

  

For a genre that trains its readers in logical deduction and fact-finding in order to eventually solve its mystery, Doyle’s “The Adventure of the Speckled Band” ultimately teaches skepticism, training readers to trace how imperial violence permeates the house it claims to protect. Literature under empire is thus bi-directional: while Empire pressures literature to naturalise imperial order, anxieties and critique regarding this order leak through its form and imagery, critiques that the text itself equips readers to realise.
