## Reading QUestions

1. In class we'll spend a lot of time talking about Chapter XX, when Dorothea is miserable on her honeymoon. Why is this the emotional and philosophical crux of the novel? Why is Dorothea miserable? Why did she marry Casaubon in the first place? What is so bad about Casaubon? Why does the novel start with Dorothea and Sir James's courtship? 
	- Chapter XX features the first time Dorothea feels that her marriage is wrong, an inkling that her imaginary, ideal future (a intellectual and religious vocation) is replaced by her real future (frustration with Casaubon's emotional distance and possible futility of his scholarship). It is where she realises that not only is this her future reality, but that she might have misjudged everything and there is no way back. It is interesting that she can't really explain it: "had no distinctly shapen grievance that she could state even to herself". I believe that this chapter stages the conflict that defines *Middlemarch* as well as Eliot's realist project: How do people come to realise reality is not what they imagined? That is, it highlights how characters come into them selves as 'real' people in a 'real' world, rather than just characters in a story.
	- I feel that Casaubon represents a sort of failed "transcendence", taking the terms from Catherine Gallagher's essay "George Eliot: Immanent Victorian". A life with him is an imagined religious intellectual life, but in actuality a sterile, detached life that seems to hollow out Dorothea's real, lived experience. It is this realisation that perhaps hints at Dorothea coming into being – that she wants a life for herself – a realisation that arises out of this emotional and philosophical moment in the novel: "she was now in an interval when the very force of her nature heightened its confusion."


	- The emotional conflict Dorothea faces is a representation of a conflict between her idealistic self, her dream of her ideal self and life, and that of reality. It serves to highlight a point in one's life where they must wrestle with the 'ordinariness' of their selves, highlighting the limits that once faces in trying to pursue the ideal life – that of the injusticies, cruelties or merely coincidences of the realistic world.
	- The ideal life that Dorothea imagines herself was one where she is able to reconcile her idealistic, religious role and sentiment of a woman and a wife with that of an intellectual. She wished to serve Casaubon as an equal in that regard, that is, as an assistant, rather than a mere wife. Yet she is undercut by his emotional distance, and the fear of futility of his intellectual pursuits.
	- Casaubon is presented to ultimately be deeply insecure, a man who is stuck in his own time and mind. This is a stark contrast between the various men that come to court Dorothea, Sir James and Lydgate.

  

2.  We'll also discuss Lydgate's experience in Middlemarch. What do we get from the inclusion of Lydgate in this novel? Why is he one of the main characters? Where does Lydgate go wrong? What does he do that’s so bad? What prevents him from realizing his professional ambitions? Why does he vote for Tyke in Chapter XVIII? Why does he marry Rosamond? What's so terrible about Rosamond?


  

3. Why is the Mary Garth-Fred Vincy plotline included in the novel? Focus, perhaps, on the chapter where Fred goes to trade his horse, Chapter XXIII. What's so likeable about Mary Garth? And Caleb Garth? 


   
4. Why is the Bulstrode storyline included in the novel? Focus maybe on Chapter LXI, where we learn his whole backstory.

5. Read the Prelude and the Finale and come prepared to discuss them. What is Eliot's aesthetic project, according to these passages?
