## Reading QUestions

1. In class we'll spend a lot of time talking about Chapter XX, when Dorothea is miserable on her honeymoon. Why is this the emotional and philosophical crux of the novel? Why is Dorothea miserable? Why did she marry Casaubon in the first place? What is so bad about Casaubon? Why does the novel start with Dorothea and Sir James's courtship? 
    

  

2.  We'll also discuss Lydgate's experience in Middlemarch. What do we get from the inclusion of Lydgate in this novel? Why is he one of the main characters? Where does Lydgate go wrong? What does he do that’s so bad? What prevents him from realizing his professional ambitions? Why does he vote for Tyke in Chapter XVIII? Why does he marry Rosamond? What's so terrible about Rosamond?
    

  

3. Why is the Mary Garth-Fred Vincy plotline included in the novel? Focus, perhaps, on the chapter where Fred goes to trade his horse, Chapter XXIII. What's so likeable about Mary Garth? And Caleb Garth? 
    
      
    
4. Why is the Bulstrode storyline included in the novel? Focus maybe on Chapter LXI, where we learn his whole backstory.
    
      
    
5. Read the Prelude and the Finale and come prepared to discuss them. What is Eliot's aesthetic project, according to these passages?
