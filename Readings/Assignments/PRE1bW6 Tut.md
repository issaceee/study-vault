## PRE1bW6 Tutorial Notes — Methods: New Historicism, Aestheticism, Literary Sociology
**Date:** 18 November 2025

## 1. Overview: Aims of the Paper
- **Paper 1b (Introduction to English Language and Literature)** focuses on applying *critical methods* to literary texts.  
- Exam questions typically ask you to “apply” or “discuss” a *methodological approach* in relation to a text.
- The aim is to show both:
  - Fluency in **theoretical frameworks and critical genealogy**, and  
  - Ability to **perform close readings** that exemplify the method’s insights.
- **Overlap between methods:** The tutor emphasised that these interpretive modes (New Historicism, Aestheticism, Literary Sociology) *blur and interrelate*. Distinctions are “not ironclad.”  
- **Most important principle:** The essay should put *method* and *object* in *mutual conversation* — each revealing something about the other.

## 2. Methodological Summaries

### A. New Historicism
- **Core idea:** All cultural artefacts (literature, politics, art) can be read as *texts* reflecting their historical moment.
- **Ontology flattened:** No hierarchy between literary and non-literary texts; all contribute to the same cultural field.
- **Practice:**
  - Read one text **against another text** from the same historical moment.
  - Construct **genealogies**—the intellectual “lineages” of historical thinking.
- **Key Theorists:** Stephen Greenblatt, Catherine Gallagher.
- **Critical Goals:**
  - Expose the *mutual entanglement* of art, history, and ideology.
  - Demonstrate *embeddedness*: how the literary form participates in historical discourse.
- **Example (Amy’s Essay on Orwell’s “Why I Write”):**
  - Orwell’s essay demonstrates **self-historicising consciousness**—he writes as both author and subject of his time.
  - The text performs the New Historicist claim that *writing is historically determined*.
  - The “four motives for writing” mirror the social and political anxieties of post-war England.
  - The tutor noted: a stronger NH essay would **juxtapose Orwell** with *contemporary cultural material* (e.g., other 1940s writers or political tracts).

---

### B. Literary Sociology
- **Definition:** Examines how *social institutions* shape and are shaped by literature.  
  - Institutions may include gender, class, marriage, education, or publishing.
- **James English (“Everywhere and Nowhere”):**
  - Argues sociology of literature is the “most diffuse” of methods — embedded across the discipline.
- **Emphasis:**
  - Attention to **structure** and **institutions** (e.g., marriage as gendered institution in Rossetti).
  - Literature is viewed as *produced within* a system of social relations.
- **Example (Ria’s Essay on Rossetti’s “An Apple-Gathering”):**
  - Reads chastity and female autonomy as *institutionally enforced social scripts*.
  - The “apple” symbol as cultural signifier of *sexual transgression*.
  - Poetic form (repetitive 4-line stanzas) mirrors **social rigidity**.
  - Could be expanded by referencing **radical feminism** (e.g., Kate Millett’s idea of “male rule through institutions”).
- **Tutor Comments:**
  - Spend *more time on theory and scholarship*—quote sociologists or literary sociologists directly.
  - Anchor every reading within a *specific institution* rather than broad social commentary.
  - Focus on how “gender” operates as *institutional condition* of production and reception.

---

### C. Aestheticism
- **Core concept (Joseph North, I.A. Richards):**  
  - The *aesthetic project* is “two-part”:  
    1. **Diagnostic** — reveals or diagnoses social habits of perception.  
    2. **Therapeutic** — re-educates the reader’s ethical and perceptual sensibilities.
- **North’s Political Aim:** Rehabilitate aesthetic education as a counter to neoliberal relativism.
- **Judgement and equality:** Taste has political function — resisting commodified “whatever-people-like” culture.
- **Example (Isaac’s Essay on Madeline Miller’s “Galatea”):**
  - “Galatea” uses aesthetic shock to retrain the reader’s moral gaze.  
  - Diagnostic: reveals how spectators aestheticise female suffering.  
  - Therapeutic: re-sensitises readers to the ethics of attention and empathy.  
  - The act of *looking without grasping* models a new moral relation between viewer and subject.
- **Tutor Notes:**
  - A strong aestheticist reading treats the *literary object as its own theorist*: the text *thinks through* the aesthetic itself.  
  - The method doesn’t “apply” theory so much as show how the text *is self-conscious of* its aesthetic conditions.

---

## 3. Comparative Frameworks and Overlaps
- All three methods explore **literature’s relation to its context**:
  - New Historicism — context as *history* (diachronic, archival).
  - Sociology — context as *structure and institution* (systemic).
  - Aestheticism — context as *readerly and perceptual* (ethical, affective).
- The *most powerful critical writing* occurs when the method and object **enrich each other**.
- “Weakness”: essays that treat methods abstractly or name-drop without demonstrating how theory *informs reading*.
- **Quoting from theorists** (Greenblatt, Gallagher, North, English, Millett) shows fluency.

---

## 4. Exam + Portfolio Advice (from Handbook and Tutor)
- **Assessment (Paper 1b):** Two essays (1,500–2,000 words each) — one on language, one on literature.
- **Best practice:**
  - Quote from theorists who “do the method.”
  - Demonstrate *close reading* and *critical self-awareness*.
  - Avoid generalising about “literature” or “society” without textual grounding.
- **For Methods Paper in Exams:**
  - Expect questions like: “Apply one of the methods we’ve discussed…” or “Discuss the relation between literature and society/history/aesthetics.”
  - Tutors advise “more time on literary scholarship” and *less on broad claims*.
  - Link every interpretive claim back to an institutional, historical, or aesthetic frame.

---

## 5. Key Takeaways
- **Don’t separate theory from text.** Use the text to test the theory, and vice versa.  
- **Mutual enrichment model:** “By doing a New Historicist reading of Orwell, we learn more about Orwell *and* about New Historicism.”
- **Institutional framing** is central to sociological reading; **self-conscious perception** is key to aestheticism.
- **Quote scholars** as evidence of methodology, not just interpretation.
- Distinctions between the methods are porous — all investigate the interplay between **literary form** and **contextual structures**.

---

### Suggested Theorists to Reference
- **New Historicism:** Stephen Greenblatt, Catherine Gallagher.  
- **Literary Sociology:** James English, Pierre Bourdieu, Raymond Williams, Kate Millett.  
- **Aestheticism:** I.A. Richards, Joseph North, Matthew Arnold, Walter Pater.

---

### For Further Reading (GENW5 Parallel)
- Julian of Norwich and Margery Kempe as early examples of *women theorising devotion through literary form* — prefigures *readerly empathy and embodied aesthetics*.
- Think cross-temporally: how methods of reading (diagnostic, contextual, institutional) can apply even to medieval devotional texts.

# Own Notes
exam questions are much more
quotation. Discuss


** theres a lot of overlap between the various methods 
- McGurl - makes literature better because it democratizes
	- modernism as an elite discourse 

theres blurring between a lot of methods

Sociological Reading
- what makes it a strictly sociological reading
- the most blurry of the methods (James English)
	- almost every method is interested in some degree between the social and literature


if trying to specify what makes it a literary sociological reading and not an adjacent method, 
* * need to spend more time on the literary scholarship
* * need to quote from people who DO the method 
	* emphasis on the sturcture and institutitons (marriage) - institution of gender 
	* need to ensure that you are operating within the paradigm of the institution


New Historicism
- continuity between the literary text and everyhting else around it
- constuction of different geneologies
- NH's whole thing was about reading one text against another text
- talk about other people at the same historical moment as orwell who was also not interested in breaking down the gestures



- most powerful use of theory - adopting a theoritical tradition - mutually enriching process when u put the method and object in conversation with each other
	- by doinga a NH reading of Orwell, it is to learn more about Orwell's embededness in history but also about NH


** powerful to construct the lineage that the theorist constructs for himself
- e.g Joseph North is calling for a return to aesthetic education at a moment when the aesthetic is dymestified under historist/contextual as being ideological suspect

** encouraged to close read theory scholarship in addition to literary object 
- treat the literaru object as its own theorist
	- instead of applying method to object but showing how the literature itself shows/thinks about the theory

literary scholar and theorists are alw invested in finding their own theory in the text itself
- that the text itself is self-conscious about the certain theory.

** different points/pieces of evidence in the same paragraph

Aestheticm
- distinctions between the methods are NOT ironclad
- IA Richards - 
- interesting way to approach exam would be to talk about Joseph North aeshtetic education has a diagnostic part (can tell us something about society - reader-response)
- therauputic - re: aesthetic education 


to do the aesthetic stuff - do you need an object that constatnly dramatizes / is self-conscious
- what does it mean to d


- judgement and equality
	- North doesnt want to rank things and come up with canon - the impulse to celebrate and denigrate others is a bad habit/impulse
	- Klune - impulse to say that eveyrthing is subjective and can choose whatever is good/bad - of apiece neo-liberal, market version --> wtv people like is good
	- taste has an important political function of fighting back against neo-liberalism and installing our own values against the market version



* * weakest when making abstract statements about methods - quote the theorists more 
* cut the introduction
