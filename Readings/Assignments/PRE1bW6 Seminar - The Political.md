* the archive
	* 'The fury archives'
	* what is an archive and what is so bad about the archive?
		* omission of details, based on a proffered 
		* information that you can use is fundamentally flawed

	- colelction of all the historical records

	- can history exists without these archives?
		- necessary to utilise the archives
		- but also can use the gaps, to speculate and see what has been unsaid

- tracing the development of theoretical frameworks from present to past (geneology)
	- read the footnotes!

Walter Ben???min - "every document of civilisation is a document of barbarism"


## Critical Fabulation
- "you cant just make up history"
	- everything in history is made up?
	- BUT shes not kjust inventing stories out of nothing - complicated and interesting combination between imagination and restraint and not just filling the gaps in the archive but REFUSING to fill in the gaps
		- what is the danger of filling and not filling gaps?

- demonstrate the fact that all history is itself fictional (even if archive has appearance of empirical, it is entangled in fiction)

- sense of satisfaction and historical closure --> danger of complacency 

- give a voice to the marginalised

- self-conscious ethics of what it means to represent or write about anything
	- ethics not just of doing the critical fabulation, anxiety of how you write about historical injustices
	- even by examining or writing upon the archive - you reproduce the violence of the archive


the conjured scene is one of such intense intimacy


romance - fictional 


process
- core legal historical documents - prosecute the women for their death



starts on a conditional subjunctive space and then moves on to a reflexive thinking


proposing a new methodology by highlighting her own writings


being self-aware that it is a critical fabulation is the thing that makes it a critical fabulation in the first place



# aisha im so lost rn



- it needs to have a kind of scholarly engagement with the archive - emphasis on *critical* fabulation
- intense self-consciousness - restraint sense of ones own limitations
==> critical, scholars, writers ==> all involved in some sort of fabulation is just that the critical fabulation critic is more self-conscious


- theorists????
	- rigour of theory announces itself

why is critical fabulation storied and not poetry

“By playing with and rearranging the basic elements of the story, by re-presenting the sequence of events in divergent stories and from contested points of view, I have attempted to jeopardize the status of the event, to displace the received or authorized account, and to imagine what might have happened or might have been said or might have been done.” (Hartman, 2008, p. 11)
- heteroglossier (to read)
	- clash of voices
- 1. make visible production of
- 2. describe resistance of the object
- 3. rearranging/flattening narrative discourse --> history itself is a contested terrain


narrative stages a rs between past present and future
- “Narrative is central to this effort because of “the relation it poses, explicit or implied, between past, presents and futures.”40 Wrestling with the girl’s claim on the present is a way of naming our time, thinking our present, and envisioning the past which has created it.” (Hartman, 2008, p. 13)


** Hartman uses a ton of rhetorical questions
- “How can narrative embody life in words and at the same time respect what we cannot know? How does one listen for the groans and cries, the undecipherable songs, the crackle of fire in the cane fields, the laments for the dead, and the shouts of victory, and then assign words to all of it?” (Hartman, 2008, p. 3)

- why is the question the dominant rhetorical mode
	- foundation of critical fabulation is that there are unanswered qns
	- that in trying to answer the question you
	- tentativeness that comes out of a critical relationship of ones own practice
	- self-consciousness
		- self-criticism,; restlessness with our own writing
	- emphasis on impossibility --> indicates critical fabulation is always incomplete and failing as a project



## Frederick Douglass

"“of which I was doomed to be a witness and a participant.” (Douglass, 2009, p. 5) douglass comes to understand himself as a subject and understands his own subjectivity through subjectivity and

“I wish I could commit to paper the feelings with which I beheld it.” (Douglass, 2009, p. 5) there is a sense that writing cannot capture truly experience


theres a self-consciousness here

but im also suspect because of the fact that this is a primary account, not really an archive in the sense of the way she describes it? - but maybe also similar in the sense that he only describes his feelings and experiences through his point of view, not that of Aunt Hester

soon the warm, red blood (amid heartrending shrieks from her, and horrid oaths from him) came dripping to the floor.
- he can only describe what he experiences

if we treat narrative of frederick douglass as the way inside of archive, we can see in the 
- self consciousness

dispute within black studies about what to do with it
- Venus: “How does one revisit the scene of subjection without replicating the grammar of violence? Is the “terrible beauty” that resides in such a scene something akin to remedy as Fred Moten would seem to suggest?14 The kind of terrible beauty and terrible music that he discerns in Aunt Hester’s screams transformed into the songs of the Great House Farm or in the photograph of Emmett Till’s destroyed face, and the “acuity of regard,”15 which arises from a willingness to look into the open casket. Do the possibilities outweigh the dangers of looking (again)?” (Hartman, 2008, p. 4)
	- Fred Moten - moment of origination where Douglass comes into consciousness - scream gets translated into sorrow songs
	- the scream that originates the black tradition
	- Hartman says this scene poses dangers: what are the dangers
		- slavemaster and douglass has speech but aunt hester doesnt have any of that
		- dangers of reproduction and reproduce the violence at the origin of the scene itself
			- “My account replicates the very order of violence that it writes against by placing yet another demand upon the girl, by requiring that her life be made useful or instructive, by finding in it a lesson for our future or a hope for history. We all know better.” (Hartman, 2008, p. 14)
	-<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;"> Seams of Subjection: famously opens with her not reproduce the scene (2nd paragraph)</mark>
		- what interests her is the way we participate? wtinesses or voyeurs?


1. critical fabulation
2. ethics of dealing with the archive and the ways archives reproduce the logic of the violence
	- made by the winners of history
	- but also even by engaging critically with these archives, we risk reproducing the dynamics that originated them
