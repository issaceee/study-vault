# Cleaned Up Notes

## PRE1bW6 Seminar Notes — “The Political”: Archives, Critical Fabulation, and Ethics  
**Seminar Topic:** Saidiya Hartman, *Venus in Two Acts*  
**Focus:** Critical fabulation, the violence of the archive, narrative ethics, representation  

---

## 1. Opening Problem: What Is “the Archive” and Why Is It Violent?

### The Archive as a Site of Power
- Archives preserve information created by institutions of domination (legal, colonial, slave-trading bureaucracies).  
- They present themselves as objective but are shaped by prejudice, omission, and the priorities of the powerful.  
- Silences and erasures are structural, not accidental.

### Why Archives Are Dangerous
- They reproduce the logic of violence embedded in their creation.  
- They tempt us into false coherence: “filling in the gaps” suggests a completeness that doesn’t exist.  
- Even reading or analysing the archive risks repeating the harm it documents.

---

## 2. Critical Fabulation: Definition and Stakes

### What Critical Fabulation Is
- A method combining **archival research** with **speculative imagination**.  
- It acknowledges what is missing while refusing to invent comforting fictions that close those gaps.  
- Relies on *both* imagination **and** restraint.

### Why Fabulate?
- To reveal the fictionality of the archive itself.  
- To resist the authority of supposedly objective documents.  
- To think from the perspective of the dispossessed without falsely inhabiting their inner lives.

### The Dangers of Critical Fabulation
- “Giving voice to the enslaved” can become a new form of violence (ventriloquism).  
- Filling gaps can produce emotional closure and complacency.  
- Representation of suffering risks aestheticising violence or turning pain into spectacle.

## 3. The Conjured Scene: Why Hartman Creates and Then Undoes It

### The Romance Passage
Hartman imagines two enslaved girls embracing each other in their final moments.

This scene:
- Contains an intimacy that could never appear in an archive.  
- Risks producing a consoling fiction — a “romance.”  
- Shows the desire to humanise, but also the ethical danger in doing so.

### Self-Reflexive Withdrawal
- Hartman immediately critiques her own imagined scene.  
- The reflexive backtracking is part of the method:  
  - She demonstrates how storytelling desires to console  
  - and how critical fabulation must *resist* that desire.

---

## 4. Why Critical Fabulation Uses Narrative (and Not Poetry or Theory)

### Narrative as Temporal Structure
- Narrative stages a relationship between past, present, and future.  
- It shows how histories bleed into the present and shape our imagination of the future.  
- It mirrors the messy simultaneity of historical experience.

### Techniques Hartman Uses
- **Rhetorical questions** → express uncertainty, ethical hesitation.  
- **Heteroglossia** → multiple voices, conflicting perspectives.  
- **Flattened narrative levels** → undermines the “authoritative voice.”  
- **Self-interruption** → ethical refusal to pretend to know.

---

## 5. Ethical Self-Consciousness: The Method Must Always Fail

- Critical fabulation is intentionally incomplete — a “history of failure.”  
- It rejects the fantasy of historical recovery.  
- It acknowledges that some forms of loss can never be repaired.  
- Ethical writing involves *knowing the limits of what can be said.*

## 6. Frederick Douglass and the Scene of Subjection

### Why Hartman Is Suspicious of Returning to This Scene
Douglass’s account of Aunt Hester’s whipping raises questions of:
- **Voyeurism** → reading the pain of others as spectacle.  
- **Repetition of violence** → each retelling retraumatises the subject.  
- **Silence** → the enslaved woman’s voice is missing; the narrative centres the spectator, not the victim.

### Competing Interpretations
- **Fred Moten** → sees Aunt Hester’s scream as the origin of Black radical tradition.  
- **Hartman** → insists that repeated looking risks reinforcing the very violence it seeks to critique.

### Why It Matters
- Even first-person accounts can become part of the harmful archive.  
- Douglass himself admits the limits of representation:  
  - “I wish I could commit to paper the feelings…”  
- This aligns with Hartman’s emphasis on the impossibility of full narrative recovery.

## 7. Hartman’s Triad: Scholar, Critic, Writer

- Hartman identifies as a **writer**, not simply a critic or theorist.  
- To write is to:
  - Acknowledge one’s participation in fabulation  
  - Accept imaginative responsibility  
  - Remain aware of the ethics of storytelling

All writing — scholarly, fictional, critical — involves fabulation.  
Critical fabulation is distinguished by its **self-awareness**.

---

## 8. Key Takeaways for Paper 1b (Method Essays)

- Critical fabulation = ethics + imagination + archival critique.  
- It highlights silences, resists closure, interrogates representation.  
- Useful for analysing:
  - Violent histories  
  - Archival absences  
  - Narrative ethics  
  - Problems of voice and silence  
- Don’t frame Hartman as “giving voice to the voiceless” → she explicitly rejects this.

## 9. Summary Concept Map

**Archive**  
→ violent, partial, structured by power  

**Critical Fabulation**  
→ imagination + restraint  
→ speculation without mastery  

**Ethics**  
→ refuse closure  
→ avoid repetition of violence  

**Narrative Form**  
→ multiple voices  
→ rhetorical questioning  
→ temporal complexity  

**Danger**  
→ voyeurism  
→ emotional satisfaction  
→ romantic closure  

**Goal**  
→ expose structural violence  
→ reveal the limits of knowledge  
→ unsettle, not soothe



# Own Notes

* the archive
	* 'The fury archives'
	* what is an archive and what is so bad about the archive?
		* omission of details, based on a proffered 
		* information that you can use is fundamentally flawed

	- colelction of all the historical records

	- can history exists without these archives?
		- necessary to utilise the archives
		- but also can use the gaps, to speculate and see what has been unsaid

- tracing the development of theoretical frameworks from present to past (geneology)
	- read the footnotes!

Walter Ben???min - "every document of civilisation is a document of barbarism"


## Critical Fabulation
- "you cant just make up history"
	- everything in history is made up?
	- BUT shes not kjust inventing stories out of nothing - complicated and interesting combination between imagination and restraint and not just filling the gaps in the archive but REFUSING to fill in the gaps
		- what is the danger of filling and not filling gaps?

- demonstrate the fact that all history is itself fictional (even if archive has appearance of empirical, it is entangled in fiction)

- sense of satisfaction and historical closure --> danger of complacency 

- give a voice to the marginalised

- self-conscious ethics of what it means to represent or write about anything
	- ethics not just of doing the critical fabulation, anxiety of how you write about historical injustices
	- even by examining or writing upon the archive - you reproduce the violence of the archive


the conjured scene is one of such intense intimacy


romance - fictional 


process
- core legal historical documents - prosecute the women for their death



starts on a conditional subjunctive space and then moves on to a reflexive thinking


proposing a new methodology by highlighting her own writings


being self-aware that it is a critical fabulation is the thing that makes it a critical fabulation in the first place



# aisha im so lost rn



- it needs to have a kind of scholarly engagement with the archive - emphasis on *critical* fabulation
- intense self-consciousness - restraint sense of ones own limitations
==> critical, scholars, writers ==> all involved in some sort of fabulation is just that the critical fabulation critic is more self-conscious


- theorists????
	- rigour of theory announces itself

why is critical fabulation storied and not poetry

“By playing with and rearranging the basic elements of the story, by re-presenting the sequence of events in divergent stories and from contested points of view, I have attempted to jeopardize the status of the event, to displace the received or authorized account, and to imagine what might have happened or might have been said or might have been done.” (Hartman, 2008, p. 11)
- heteroglossier (to read)
	- clash of voices
- 1. make visible production of
- 2. describe resistance of the object
- 3. rearranging/flattening narrative discourse --> history itself is a contested terrain


narrative stages a rs between past present and future
- “Narrative is central to this effort because of “the relation it poses, explicit or implied, between past, presents and futures.”40 Wrestling with the girl’s claim on the present is a way of naming our time, thinking our present, and envisioning the past which has created it.” (Hartman, 2008, p. 13)


** Hartman uses a ton of rhetorical questions
- “How can narrative embody life in words and at the same time respect what we cannot know? How does one listen for the groans and cries, the undecipherable songs, the crackle of fire in the cane fields, the laments for the dead, and the shouts of victory, and then assign words to all of it?” (Hartman, 2008, p. 3)

- why is the question the dominant rhetorical mode
	- foundation of critical fabulation is that there are unanswered qns
	- that in trying to answer the question you
	- tentativeness that comes out of a critical relationship of ones own practice
	- self-consciousness
		- self-criticism,; restlessness with our own writing
	- emphasis on impossibility --> indicates critical fabulation is always incomplete and failing as a project



## Frederick Douglass

"“of which I was doomed to be a witness and a participant.” (Douglass, 2009, p. 5) douglass comes to understand himself as a subject and understands his own subjectivity through subjectivity and

“I wish I could commit to paper the feelings with which I beheld it.” (Douglass, 2009, p. 5) there is a sense that writing cannot capture truly experience


theres a self-consciousness here

but im also suspect because of the fact that this is a primary account, not really an archive in the sense of the way she describes it? - but maybe also similar in the sense that he only describes his feelings and experiences through his point of view, not that of Aunt Hester

soon the warm, red blood (amid heartrending shrieks from her, and horrid oaths from him) came dripping to the floor.
- he can only describe what he experiences

if we treat narrative of frederick douglass as the way inside of archive, we can see in the 
- self consciousness

dispute within black studies about what to do with it
- Venus: “How does one revisit the scene of subjection without replicating the grammar of violence? Is the “terrible beauty” that resides in such a scene something akin to remedy as Fred Moten would seem to suggest?14 The kind of terrible beauty and terrible music that he discerns in Aunt Hester’s screams transformed into the songs of the Great House Farm or in the photograph of Emmett Till’s destroyed face, and the “acuity of regard,”15 which arises from a willingness to look into the open casket. Do the possibilities outweigh the dangers of looking (again)?” (Hartman, 2008, p. 4)
	- Fred Moten - moment of origination where Douglass comes into consciousness - scream gets translated into sorrow songs
	- the scream that originates the black tradition
	- Hartman says this scene poses dangers: what are the dangers
		- slavemaster and douglass has speech but aunt hester doesnt have any of that
		- dangers of reproduction and reproduce the violence at the origin of the scene itself
			- “My account replicates the very order of violence that it writes against by placing yet another demand upon the girl, by requiring that her life be made useful or instructive, by finding in it a lesson for our future or a hope for history. We all know better.” (Hartman, 2008, p. 14)
	-<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;"> Seams of Subjection: famously opens with her not reproduce the scene (2nd paragraph)</mark>
		- what interests her is the way we participate? wtinesses or voyeurs?


1. critical fabulation
2. ethics of dealing with the archive and the ways archives reproduce the logic of the violence
	- made by the winners of history
	- but also even by engaging critically with these archives, we risk reproducing the dynamics that originated them
