scholars as using New Historicists [[PRE1bW3 Seminar New Historicism]]

nH as taking over in the 70s and 80s 

Frederick Jameson is the biggest Marxist literary scholar (scholar)

North lumps a lot of disparate method under the Historicist/Contextualists
- but jameson vs the new historicists is abit different
- choosese jameson because he is writing for readers the lean left (jameson whose methods are questionable and to whose thinking the readers lean towards)


politics of aesthetics
scholar is backward oriented vs the critic as looking towards the present/future
- theres no way of enacting knowledge production because it is just located within the university and scholarship system

moving past and encapsulating the argument as a way of 


before (ww2 as dividing the century)
pre 1945
post 1945

Norht's periodisation
1914 - 1930
- liberalism is under exceeding stress, economic depressions
1940s - 1970s
- golden age of industrial capitalism --> criticism
	- criticism here is judgment; betrays what joseph north feels criticism is
1970s - 2000s
- neoliberal period --> new historicism
==> North believes that these moments in political economic society
- superstructure of structure that emerges out of the capital, economic structure base

unfolding of literature history maps onto the unfolding of historical events
- but actually North's 


- no matte rhow completely charged the methods are made out to be, for North, they are still part of the neoliberalism project


historicism as a containment of leftist literary energyu

"“Perhaps we can now see something of the dual political character of our period’s governing injunction to “historicize.” Insofar as it has led to a critique of the essentialisms and universalisms of an old elite, it has been palpably of the left. Yet insofar as it has also asked literary thinkers to give up the wider social function to which “criticism,” for all its many faults, at least aspired, and has taught them instead merely to observe the culture, however “critically,” by writing cultural theory and cultural history, it has been a depoliticization: in that sense, of the right.” (North, 2017, p. 12)"
- it lost a bigger battle in the larger social terrain

what the text is saying in itself vs how it responds to the context
- not really retreating from politics that it is infact more political
## A Chicken

“literary criticism” was an institutional program of aesthetic education—an attempt to enrich the culture directly by cultivating new ranges of sensibility, new modes of subjectivity, new capacities for experience—using works of literature as a means.” (North, 2017, p. 6)
- in A Chicken this figures as allowing the reader a little insight into the feelings/actions of a chicken
- so its like how the text itself allows the reader to "feel" what the chicken feels?
- things like the vascillation between "apathy and alarm" - which the chicken feels herself - is also felt by the audience as the action scene constantly jumps between action and breaks, the sentences as well "For a second she wavered—long enough for the cook to cry out—and soon was on the neighbor’s terrace, from which, in another awkward flight, she reached a roof."
	- for this apathy and alarm it also relates to the reader in the sense that the story constantly paints the chicken as 'just' a chicken in many parts of the text, yet constatnly gives us a lot of insight into the feelings and thoughts to the chicken - allowing us to feel alarm for the chicken's situation even as we are told to feel apathetic
- even the 'complacency' of sorts that the chicken paradoxically feels but doesnt feel is undercut by the last line

- allegory of female experience
	- subject of female experience (dont have a distinct personality)
	- women arent really treated as like people in society


- the story seems to occupy a middle ground

- “And then she seemed so free.” (Lispector, 2015, p. 122) short absolute syntax reflects the freedom she experiences suddenly

- the way that we functionalise the chicken and women - vascillating back and forth between giving and not giving moral education 

aesthetic assumes a delineation between the political and personal

- internalised the idea that aesthetic hierarchy is bad


cultural gatekeepr
later 19th century - emerging class of industrialists who have all these money and who are kept out (new money vs old money - new culture vs old culture)
- performing social distinctions
- taste has a highly regulatory, social force even if its arbritary and contingent
- culture is still working to distinguish

read [[@cluneJudgmentEquality2019]]--> dissolution of hierarchies 
- need to embrace judgement and hierarchies as a way to fight against the dominant values
- one of the ways in which criticsm betrays is that they were more invested in aesthetic autonomy (deatched from politics) 
- clune here is trying to practice aesthetics without disconnecting it from politics, and being embdedded in political institutions
- NH is about revealing that mid-century criticism is about disconnecting art and politics
