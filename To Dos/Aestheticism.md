## **A. Summaries of the Four Works**

### **1. Pierre Bourdieu — _Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste_ (1984)** [[@bourdieuDistinctionSocialCritique2002]]

Bourdieu’s sociological study redefines aesthetic judgment as a socially conditioned practice rather than a disinterested universal faculty (as Kant envisioned). Taste, he argues, is a marker of class distinction: it classifies the classifier. Cultural preferences—whether for classical music, modern art, or cuisine—function as expressions of habitus (the internalized dispositions formed by one’s class position). The “aesthetic disposition” prized by elites (a detached, formalist, and “pure” gaze) arises only in those economically free from necessity, whose leisure allows them to valorize form over function. By contrast, the working-class “taste of necessity” values the functional and emotionally direct. Thus, aesthetic judgment is a mechanism of symbolic domination, legitimizing inequality by framing elite sensibility as universal and “pure.”

**Takeaway:** Taste is not innocent; it is a social weapon that transforms material privilege into symbolic superiority. Aesthetic judgment is deeply political because it naturalizes hierarchy.

### **2. Sianne Ngai — “Merely Interesting” (2008)** [[@ngaiMerelyInteresting2008]]

Ngai examines “interesting” as a modern aesthetic category that displaces the grand affects (like beauty or the sublime) with a cooler, more cognitive mode of engagement. “Interesting” emerges as a postmodern aesthetic that fuses knowledge and feeling—it signals attention without strong affective commitment, and functions as a “weak aesthetic judgment” in an era where the critic’s authority is unstable. Ngai shows that “interesting” is both epistemic (it tells us _something matters to know about_) and aesthetic (it marks a minor pleasure of attention and curiosity). The term’s banality masks its function in contemporary culture, where it structures how we evaluate artworks, social media content, and academic discourse.

**Takeaway:** “Interesting” is the paradigmatic aesthetic of late modernity—an ambivalent, low-intensity judgment that bridges epistemic curiosity and affective detachment. It reveals how aesthetic evaluation has adapted to a culture of constant novelty and professionalized critique.

### **3. Michael W. Clune — “Judgment and Equality” (2019)** [[@cluneJudgmentEquality2019]]

Clune identifies a modern paradox: critics and teachers desire the egalitarian promise of aesthetic experience (everyone can perceive beauty) yet avoid making evaluative judgments (ranking, preferring, distinguishing) for fear of reinforcing inequality. He argues that abandoning aesthetic judgment—especially in education—cedes evaluative authority to the market, where popularity becomes the only measure of value. Defending judgment, for Clune, is not elitist but democratic: it allows art to model non-market forms of valuation and to sustain aesthetic education as a critical, moral, and political practice.

**Takeaway:** The defense of aesthetic judgment is essential to democratic equality because it provides an alternative to capitalist valuation. Judgment, far from oppressive, enables collective cultivation of taste.

### **4. Joseph North — _Literary Criticism: A Concise Political History_ (2017)** [[@northLiteraryCriticismConcise2017]]

North reconstructs the political history of literary study in the Anglophone academy. He distinguishes between two dominant paradigms: the **“critical”** (formalist, aesthetic, cultivating sensibility) and the **“scholarly/historicist”**(contextual, explanatory, professionalized). The shift from the critical to the scholarly model, he argues, depoliticized the aesthetic, sidelining its transformative, ethical, and collective potential. For North, reclaiming the aesthetic means reasserting criticism’s capacity to cultivate perception, feeling, and imagination—not to retreat into “art for art’s sake,” but to reinvest literary form with political and pedagogical force.

**Takeaway:** Aesthetic criticism, properly understood, is political because it trains perception and moral imagination; neglecting it surrenders literature’s transformative social function.

## **B. What “Aestheticism” Means Across These Four Thinkers**

|Thinker|Core Idea|Key Contribution to Aestheticism|
|---|---|---|
|**Bourdieu**|Aesthetic judgment as social distinction|Reveals the class-bound nature of “pure” taste; aestheticism is an ideology of power that masks material inequality through claims of refinement.|
|**Ngai**|The “interesting” as weak aesthetic judgment|Shows how aesthetic discourse has adapted to professional and epistemic demands; aestheticism today is low-intensity, self-reflexive, and conceptually mediated.|
|**Clune**|Judgment as moral and political necessity|Reclaims aesthetic evaluation as an ethical practice essential to democracy and education.|
|**North**|The aesthetic as critical pedagogy|Reframes aesthetic practice as a mode of social formation and moral cultivation within institutions.|

### **Synthesis: Aestheticism Reconsidered**

From these four, aestheticism emerges not as escapist “art for art’s sake,” but as a **contested practice of attention, judgment, and social distinction.**

- **Epistemic dimension (Ngai, North):** The aesthetic is a way of knowing—of training perception, articulating difference, and mediating feeling and understanding.
    
- **Social dimension (Bourdieu):** The aesthetic is historically situated and classed; “pure” taste is itself a social construct.
    
- **Ethical dimension (Clune):** Judgment and taste are forms of care, teaching us how to discern, not merely consume.
    
- **Political dimension (North, Bourdieu):** Aesthetic education and critical practice can reproduce or resist inequality depending on how judgment is exercised.
    

Thus, **aestheticism = the politics of perception**—a reflexive practice where how we attend, value, and judge art is inseparable from the structures of power and pedagogy that shape us. In this modern sense, to be “an aestheticist” is not to flee politics but to make visible the politics inherent in attention, form, and taste.
