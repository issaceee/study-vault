      "text": "I argue that the text borrows credibility from its use of techniques in scientific writing, specifically utilising the language of empirical investigation, yet by saturating the narrative with data so excessively it becomes absurd, Poe parodies scientific writing at the time, highlighting how scientific authority at the time relied more on society's belief in his claims, rather than empirical justification of the claims. By vacillating between the two genres of scientific writing and sensationalism, Poe ultimately presents Science as both a parody and participant in this print culture. The scientific, empirical report becomes one that is fallible – a genre that must perform belief in order to sustain its claim to truth.",
