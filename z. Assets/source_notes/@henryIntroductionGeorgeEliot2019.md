“It is also, necessarily, a kind of authenticity, an honest representation of one’s own feelings and perceptions; otherwise accuracy of representation would be impossible.” (Henry and Levine, 2019, p. 6) 
- realism is not only about accruacy of representation of events, but that the precursor of accuracy is honest, truthful, and authentic representation of feelings and perceptions.


==REALISM aims not for Representation of REALITY, but of TRUTH==

> Eliot fits neither conventionally defined aesthetic nor political positions. She created her art out of a cluster of rebellions, particularly against reigning social, moral, and aesthetic conventions, yet she considered herself a “conservative-reformer.

> opposed to revolution, disturbed at any sudden tear in the social fabric, and she dramatized the dangers of political violence often – in Romola, Felix Holt, and Middlemarch, in particular. The foundation for this position was sharply articulated in her essay on the anthropologist Wilhelm Heinrich von Riehl: “What has grown up historically can only die out historically, by the gradual operation of necessary laws” (Pinney, p. 287). But she also saw clearly enough to understand and represent with great force temptations to violence.

> Her legacy would be badly distorted if we were to look at the novels as frozen “classics,” rather than as works created by an imagination deeply informed by the nitty-gritty of social engagement, of contemporary controversy, of anything but a pure life.

> Morality and dogma without mercy and love are neither morality nor religion. Focusing on the tension between private experience and social constraint, these essays suggest how Eliot defined her work against the distortions that pass for truth and justice

> The energizing principle of Eliot’s art was realism, a mode that depends heavily on reaction against what the writer takes to have been misrepresentation. Thus, even for those “realists” whose politics might have turned out to be “conservative,” it is a rebellious mode.
