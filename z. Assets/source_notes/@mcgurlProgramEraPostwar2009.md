McGurl argues that the creative writing program was the most important event in postwar American literary history, causing not a decline but a transformation of literature into a discourse more complex, varied and institutionally shaped. He argues that rather than seeing the programmatic culture is inherently binary (institution vs individual), the two are inherently interconnected – the institution in postwar American history is formative for the development of the individual, their styles and their writings. 

McGurl highlights the central tension between modernist ideals vs. bureaucratic institutions that seem to underlie the move into a programmatic writing culture. The modernist values of individual creative and artistic freedom born outside of formal institutions seem inherently opposed to the centralised, programmed formal institutions and programmes that popped up postwar. He brings up the example of Nabokov here, a literary outsider who taught in these institutions.

Nevertheless he highlights that these formal institutions actuall serve as the birthsite for variance and individuality – that the system is not uniform but encourages different outcomes. He highlights how the era's reflexivity is not only a stylistic, individual choice made by writers of the time, but one that correlates with institutional circumstances at the time – authors and writers who are socialised and learning in programs writing about authors and institutions.

By highlighting how family shapes who we are, proven by countless texts in the period, he claims that school naturally picks up where family leaves off – thereby suggesting that these programs and institutions serve as formative experiences that constitute subjectivity and shape writers' individual voice and style.





1. Institutionalization of creative writing is *the* defining devt of postwar American literature --> a structural, integral event that explains the period's aesthetics and organisation
	- programs that shape writing styles and careers, reframing readings of novels as social/institutional products rather than only as isolated aesthetic achievements
	- postwar fiction as the product of a system “ingeniously geared to the production of variety,
		- that programs are designed to create variation rather than flattening postwar fiction
2. the system of programs produces authors and authorial styles (rather than individual genius)
	- the system is NOT uniform, but encourages different outcomes
3. modernist ideals vs bureaucratic institutions as the central tension
	- modernism as an ideal or value that were practiced/experimented with by writers outside formal institutions BUT with the advent of writing programms in universities, they become sites where these values could be taught and practiced
	- for techniques that prioritise individuality and creative freedom and experimentation, how do you reconcile it with the rigidity, centralization and organisation of an organised, institutionalised teaching institution.
	- Nabokov as a literary outsider who taught in these institutions – Nabokov resists but the new programs embody
4. metafiction and reflexivity as an ionstitution symptom
	- The era’s reflexivity/metafiction (surfiction) — texts that make art, authorship, and narrative self-conscious — is not only an intellectual or stylistic choice but correlates with institutional circumstances: authors trained and socialized in programs write about authors and institutions.
	- he brings Nabokov and examples like _Pale Fire_ to show how authorial self-obsession and formal doubling (Kinbote, Shade, etc.) dramatize the author’s relation to institutions and to their own personhood.
	- individuals and organizations constantly monitor and narrate themselves.
	- metafiction = literary surface symptom; underlying it is institutionalized self-monitoring.
	- “the obsessive reflexivity of Nabokov’s work an aesthetic of “involution,” and it was of a piece with a broader postwar codification and intensification of modernist reflexivity in the form of what came to be called “surfiction” or, more durably, “metafiction.” (McGurl, 2009, p. 9)
5. Experience vs Creativity: the autopoetic process
	- creative writing is inherently binary - Experience (authenticity, memory, personal content) vs Creativity (imaginative transformation)
	- these values interact to become creative writing
6. Universities as mediators of market/experience economies
	- Postwar universities mediate writers’ relations to the market and to the culture industry; programs both shelter writers from market precarity and shape literature to function as an “experiential commodity” in the broader experience economy.
		- - Sociological framing: borrows “information economy” and “experience economy” (Pine & Gilmore) to show writers and programs as participating in commodified symbolic production.
		- he compares novels and creative writing instruction to tourism/souvenirs — novels are memorable experiences; workshops sell students the experience of authorship.
		- Evidence from practice: tuition, career structures, workshops, and the graduate-as-apprentice model are treated as economic/institutional facts that alter what literature looks like.

** Institutions produce individuality – family --> school --> program
- institutions constitute subjectivity so programmatic training shapes the modern literary self --> institutional influence thus is formative of individuality
- family - school as structures that "make us who we are" ==> continuity
	- Postwar American literature provides endless testimony, for starters, of the agonizing importance of the institution of the family in making us who we are—and the school picks up where the family leaves off.
- not as simple as individual vs institution

> Far from occasioning a sad  decline in the quality or interest of American literature, as one so often  hears, the writing program has generated a complex and evolving constellation of aesthetic problems that have been explored with tremendous energy—and at times great brilliance—by a vast range of writers who have  also been students and teachers

> he creation of a narrator like Humbert, whose ethical complexity  is a form of authorial defiance. He is unreliable in the usual sense that the  reader cannot necessarily trust what he says, but on another level he represents Nabokov’s aestheticism, his high-handed commitment to the “unreliability” of art itself, which should not be tasked with the fulfillment  of extra-artistic ends—certainly not moral-pedagogical ones, perhaps not  even the end of paying the bills.

>> Humbert as a reflection of his author's agenda and wants and messaging - a defiance to the instituttional programs that he is stuck in for material anf financial necessities.

> creative writing cannot help pointing toward  the unglamorous institutional practicalities of literary life in the postwar  U.S. and beyond. This, as we shall see, is the realm not only of institutions  but also of technologies, the hard and soft machines in and by which literature comes into being.

> Its obsessive reflexivity produces an intimidating effect of hyper-cleverness, true, but this is less the working out  of an interesting idea than a career-long compositional reflex: everyone in  the novels, including the person at the source of their utterance, is subject  to an ongoing process of figural doubling, division, rotation, and reversal—a sequencing of formal-ontological differentiation along various axes  of identity

> act of programmatic self-establishment, an elaborately performative “I  am.” Using his own preferred idiom of fairy tale and romance, it could  be described as a way for a king-in-exile to recover his country and reassert his rule on a linguistic-aesthetic plane. Nabokov’s lifelong attractionsometimes ironic, sometimes not—to the traditional romance motif of  unrecognized royalty is fabulously evident in Pale Fire, where the deranged  editor Kinbote has (at least in his own mind) been chased from the throne  of the nation of Zembla to his ignominious dwelling at Wordsmith College, U.S.A

> On one level, of course, the  information in which these employees traffic plays the other to literature.  As William R. Paulson has recounted, since the nineteenth century texts  have been considered “literary” to the degree that their value does not  seem reducible to the information they convey, and an author is in fact  distinct from the typical information worker to the extent that she is an independent producer and owner of the fruits of her labor. And yet if we  conceptualize literature, as Paulson does, as a kind of “noise” that opens  the world of information to its outside—and thus to generation of new  and potentially useful orders of information—it can be seen to have a special sort of utility in that world, a job to do.23

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> Although the  practice of creative writing is grounded in the value of personal experience, it is in theory “set free” by the imagination which reshapes that experience to a greater or lesser degree.

> The fervor of our lip service to creativity is matched only by the enthusiasm of  our paeans to personal experience. If, in the chapters that follow, I seem  too willing to discount the enchantments of the first, and question the authority of the second, it is only in the interest of restoring some balance in  favor of the claims of the collective life we live through institutions.
