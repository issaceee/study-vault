# Philip Gould — *The Rise, Development, and Circulation of the Slave Narrative* (notes) 

## Quick summary
- Gould locates the slave narrative’s origins in late-18th-century intellectual and religious shifts (Enlightenment humanism, sentimentalism, evangelical Protestantism), which created the cultural and institutional conditions for black autobiography to appear and circulate.   
- Early narratives (1770s–1830s) blended genres: spiritual autobiography, captivity tale, adventure/picaresque, political petition — often published with evangelical or abolitionist support.   
- By the antebellum era (1830s–1850s) abolitionist politics (Garrisonians, AASS) re-focused the genre on Southern plantation abuses, turning narratives into documentary evidence used by abolitionists.   
- The genre always negotiated tensions: religious vs. secular argument, authentic voice vs. editorial mediation, moral persuasion vs. marketability. 

## Timeline & development (bullet form)
- **1770s–1780s**: First slave narratives appear; transatlantic circulation; evangelical sponsors.   
- **1787–1807**: Rise of organized antislavery societies; narratives tied to abolitionist politics.   
- **1830s–1840s**: Radicalization of American abolitionism (Garrison, AASS); narratives emphasize plantation evidence and first-hand brutality.   
- **1850s–1860s**: Slave narratives become a mass-market phenomenon and a recognized (if contested) part of American letters. 

## Key themes (short)
- **Enlightenment + Evangelical overlap** — intellectual arguments and the language of conversion both legitimize anti-slavery claims.   
- **Hybrid genre / generic fluidity** — flexibility allows narrators to address multiple audiences simultaneously.   
- **Authenticity & editorial mediation** — white editors, prefaces, and abolitionist patrons frequently shaped how narratives were presented.   
- **Performance & orality** — many narrators gained reputations as orators before becoming authors; lecture circuit shaped content and style.   
- **Commercialization** — by mid-19th century narratives were both political tools and print commodities. 

## Important examples (with one-line notes)
- **Briton Hammon** — early work that adopts “civilized/English” persona and uses captivity/adventure forms.   
- **James Gronniosaw** — early evangelical conversion narrative; circulated in Britain and America.   
- **Olaudah Equiano (Interesting Narrative, 1789)** — links autobiography to abolitionist politics; commercially successful and widely translated.   
- **Ottobah Cugoano** — radical political attack on the slave trade; explicitly frames arguments within the abolitionist literature.   
- **Frederick Douglass** — models the antebellum shift: oratory, detailed evidence, and negotiation of editorial/abolitionist pressures. 

## Representative short quotations (<=25 words) — useful as short epigraphs or evidence
- “The slave narrative first emerged during the 1770s and 1780s…”   
- “Evangelical groups... took an interest in black autobiographies because of their spiritual value in disseminating religious ideas.”   
- “The central abolitionist project of exposing the evils of the Southern plantation... became the absolute priority of the antebellum slave narrative.”   
- “The Interesting Narrative subsequently went through thirteen editions in the first five years after its London publication in 1789.” 

## Suggested thesis/essay lines (ready to adapt)
- “Gould argues that the slave narrative emerged at the crossroads of Enlightenment reform and evangelical print culture, enabling former slaves to deploy hybrid genres for political persuasion.”   
- “By the antebellum era the slave narrative had been transformed into documentary evidence — a form shaped as much by abolitionist demands for proof as by market incentives.” 

## Analysis angles / essay prompts
- How did **evangelical sponsorship** shape the rhetoric and themes of early slave narratives? Use Gronniosaw and Marrant as case studies.   
- Compare **Equiano’s economic and Enlightenment arguments** against slavery with earlier religiously framed narratives. What changes in audience and purpose does this reflect?   
- Examine the tension between **authenticity and editorial control** in antebellum narratives (Douglass, Jacobs) — who controls the “voice”?   
- How did the **lecture circuit and orality** influence the written forms of slave narratives? Consider performance conventions and limitations. 

## Quick bibliography (from Gould’s notes — to follow up)

# Philip Gould — *The Rise, Development, and Circulation of the Slave Narrative* (Analysed Key Quotes)  

## 1. Enlightenment & the intellectual roots of antislavery
> “One was the rise of secular social philosophy, based on humanitarian principles and contractual terms for human association and government, found in such thinkers as Baron Montesquieu and John Locke… Another important development was the rise of sentimentalism… A third development… was the proliferation of more radical and revolutionary ideas about natural rights vis-à-vis state and social forms of authority.”  

**Analysis:**  
Gould outlines three converging Enlightenment forces that underpinned early antislavery thought:  
1. **Lockean contractualism** — challenged divine justification for slavery.  
2. **Sentimentalism** — connected emotional virtue to moral reform.  
3. **Revolutionary natural rights** — made liberty an inalienable human principle.  
These intellectual climates gave the slave narrative its moral and philosophical grounding.

---

## 2. Standardisation of the genre
> “...did not entirely nationalize or secularize the slave narrative, but it did produce new literary conventions, rework traditional ones, and effectively standardize all of them to the point where the slave narrative was an easily imitated – and sometimes forged – literary form.”  

**Analysis:**  
By the 1830s–40s, the slave narrative evolved into a **recognisable formula**, blending personal testimony, religious conversion, and documentary realism. This “standardisation” both legitimised and constrained black self-expression — authenticity became both expected and doubted.

---

## 3. Civilised / Christian identity
> “The first black autobiographers largely wrote within the norms of ‘civilized’ or ‘Christian’ identity – one that was more often than not associated directly with ‘Englishness.’”  

**Analysis:**  
Early black writers like Hammon and Marrant adopted the language of **English civility and Christian virtue** to claim moral and intellectual parity with their readers — a rhetorical strategy that turned imperial discourse against itself.

---

## 4. The rhetoric of liberty
> “...deliberately ambiguous as a way of being able to access the language of English liberty... and to thereby legitimize himself by exploiting the period’s anti-Catholic fervor and assuaging anxieties about slave unrest in Massachusetts.”  

**Analysis:**  
Hammon’s ambiguity about “service” allowed him to appropriate the rhetoric of **English freedom** while sidestepping direct political confrontation. The passage demonstrates how black authors navigated existing ideological frameworks to speak indirectly about freedom.

---

## 5. Generic fluidity
> “Unlike the antebellum slave narrative, eighteenth-century narratives were more generically fluid... The generic field includes spiritual autobiography, the conversion narrative, the providential tale, criminal confession, Indian captivity narrative, sea adventure story, and the picaresque novel.”  

**Analysis:**  
Before the genre solidified, slave narratives borrowed from **popular literary forms** to reach multiple audiences. This hybridity helped black authors enter print culture under familiar narrative masks, using convention to smuggle radical content.

---

## 6. Criminal conversion & commerce
> “...the criminal conversion narrative, often published in broadside form. Many of these texts displayed an uneasy tension between evangelical didacticism and titillating commercial value.”  

**Analysis:**  
Slave narratives existed within a **commercial moral economy**— balancing pious instruction with sensational appeal. This tension mirrors later debates about authenticity and spectacle in abolitionist print culture.

---

## 7. Sentimental autobiography & political overlap
> “The sentimental drama of the slave trade’s disruption of the African home, and the moral bankruptcy of social law compared with natural law… Political writing overlaps with and is animated by sentimental autobiography – the slave’s story of the loss of family and home.”  

**Analysis:**  
Sentiment became political. Emotional appeals to sympathy humanised the enslaved and exposed the moral failures of law — merging **feeling with argument**, a key abolitionist strategy.

---

## 8. Personal experience as political argument
> “...blend personal experience with political polemic, lending political arguments the emotional weight of autobiography, and providing a source of political arguments for the developing slave narrative.”  

**Analysis:**  
Gould shows that **autobiography became political evidence** — the enslaved person’s self-story carried moral force unavailable to abstract polemic. This fusion defines the genre’s rhetorical power.

---

## 9. Religious genre & dual captivity
> “Early narratives were as much stories of spiritual as bodily captivity and liberation... The ability of black autobiographers to signify on religious and political registers simultaneously lay largely in the elasticity of the language they used.”  

**Analysis:**  
Spiritual and physical bondage were intertwined. The **Bible’s language of salvation** doubled as a language of freedom, allowing black authors to write liberation through theological metaphor.

---

## 10. Evangelical Protestantism & identity
> “Evangelical Protestantism provided many of the categories and tropes through which black autobiographers… fashioned ‘civilized’ identities for public consumption.”  

**Analysis:**  
Evangelical discourse shaped how black writers were expected to present themselves — humble, pious, redeemed — creating a **performative script** that both enabled and restricted expression.

---

## 11. Antislavery print culture
> “Antislavery print culture provided the slave narrative with flexible rhetorical strategies and helped to sharpen its political focus.”  

**Analysis:**  
The rise of abolitionist publishing networks (pamphlets, sermons, reports) gave black authors new **rhetorical models** and audiences, transforming the narrative into a direct instrument of political activism.

---

## 12. Radical tone of Cugoano
> “Cugoano’s prose style... reveals the radical turn in contemporary antislavery politics. Cast in the language of the jeremiad, his outraged tone is far more apparent than... Gronniosaw’s or Marrant’s.”  

**Analysis:**  
Cugoano represents a **shift from pious to prophetic anger** — using the biblical jeremiad to indict society’s moral failures. This marks a transition from compliance to confrontation within the genre.

---

## 13. Reclaiming Locke
> “Whereas proslavery writers traditionally justified slavery according to ‘natural’ rights to property, antislavery writings re-possessed Locke’s ideas to argue for the absurdity of equating human beings... with material possessions.”  

**Analysis:**  
This is the intellectual **reversal of Enlightenment logic**: the same liberal philosophy used to defend property was weaponised to assert universal human liberty.

---

## 14. Full humanity of the African
> “The slave narrative’s central proposition [was] the full humanity of the African… the singular nature (‘monogenist’ view) of humanity and the moral responsibility to uphold humanitarian ideals.”  

**Analysis:**  
At its core, the genre functioned as **anthropological argument**—a textual assertion of shared humanity across racial lines, grounded in both Christian and Enlightenment universalism.

---

## 15. Documentary realism
> “The genre now focused... on the actual, daily conditions of slave life, because abolitionist readers and publishers desired – indeed required – that kind of detailed evidence.”  

**Analysis:**  
Abolitionist readers demanded verifiable realism. The slave narrative became **documentary testimony**, balancing moral outrage with empirical detail to serve as abolitionist “proof.”

---

## 16. Circulation of tropes & shared conventions
> “It borrows from them and provides factual material for them, so that these genres inter-animate one another... scenes of brutal whipping and torture... hypocrisy of Southern Christianity... all become standard fare.”  

**Analysis:**  
By the 1840s, the slave narrative had developed a **stable repertoire of scenes** — violence, hypocrisy, resistance — shared across literature, journalism, and visual culture. Repetition ensured recognition and credibility.

---

## 17. The abolitionist lecture circuit
> “The abolitionist lecture circuit was an important development shaping the style and content of the antebellum slave narrative.”  

**Analysis:**  
Oral performance preceded publication. The narrative voice was honed on stage — persuasive, emotive, rhythmic — shaping the later written style and public image of black authors.

---

## 18. The abolitionist forum
> “The abolitionist forum provides a crucial rhetorical context – the limitations of voice, the bounds of propriety, the humility of self-presentation – for evaluating the slave narratives during this period.”  

**Analysis:**  
Public speaking both empowered and constrained. The ex-slave was expected to be **humble yet eloquent**, authentic yet deferential — illustrating how black voices were mediated through white abolitionist propriety.

---

## 19. Persistence of religion
> “Antebellum culture was still highly religious; evangelical institutions exerted significant influence on the world of antebellum publishing.”  

**Analysis:**  
Even as abolitionist discourse became more political, **Christian publishing networks** remained central to production and credibility. The narrative never fully secularized — spiritual redemption continued to anchor freedom’s rhetoric.

---

## Synthesis / Essay takeaway
Across its evolution, the slave narrative moved:
- from **religious conversion** → to **political testimony** → to **literary commodity**,  
while maintaining a consistent moral centre: the assertion of African humanity.  
Gould frames this history as both **a story of self-representation** and **a study of mediation**, showing how black voices negotiated Enlightenment ideals, evangelical piety, and print capitalism to enter the modern public sphere.

> One was the rise of secular social philosophy, based on humanitarian principles and contractual terms for human association and government, found in such thinkers as Baron Montesquieu and John Locke, which drastically narrowed the traditional Christian rationale for slavery as the natural extension of the “slavery” of human sin.1 Another important development was the rise of sentimentalism in the eighteenth century, which, related to evangelical religion, popular fiction, and urban cultures of refinement, raised the importance of the virtues of sympathy and benevolence as well as the cultural refinement accompanying them. A third development, especially important in the 1790s, was the proliferation of more radical and revolutionary ideas about natural rights vis- `a-vis state and social forms of authority.
