250 word summary:

What does Watt notice about the passage? How does he build out from local observations about the passage to some larger point? What is this larger point? Why does Watt think this passage is so significant? Why does he pick the passage that he does? Could he do the same analysis on any passage in James's novel? How many times did Watt need to read this passage before he could understand its larger significance?


Instead of descriptive prose, Watt posits that James uses precise diction and grammatical/syntactical functions to draw the reader's attention towards the main conflict in the novel, as well as reflect James's outlook towards life. Some examples are James's use of non-transitive verbs, abstract nouns and negation to generalise Strether's thinking. In universalising the language and context, Watt argues that these small textual details become free from a particular temporal and physical realm, and therefore "[exist] independently of its context", thereby being able to "relate every event and every moment of life to the full complexity of its circumambient conditions."

I personally found Watt's argument regarding James's tone being humorous rather than ironic most interesting as it highlights the reception of the novel by the audience. In his analysis, Watt argues that the narrative is 'multidimensional', continually implicating "a community of three minds–Strether's,James's, and the reader's". Particularly, Watt highlights a deliberate "balance of intention", in which "we feel for him even more than we smile at him", further highlighting James's precision in writing.

Watt ends his analysis by comparing this passage to other opening passages by renowned authors. It is in this comparison that Watt underscores James's mastery in keeping "so many levels of meaning and impliction [...] in continuous operation", a mastery that is reflective of James's unique narrative texture, and thus I believe could possibly be seen in other passages in this specific novel. However, I believe that his other novels would reflect the beliefs/state of James at the time of writing them, as it has been argued that James's later writing style differ significantly from his earlier texts.


500-Word Summary:

 Watt's introduction highlights the various strengths and weaknesses of literary analyses techniques over the decades from various cultures and regions. Mainly, he underscores the contrast between close reading (Practical Criticism - Anglo-Americans) and context reading (<i>explication de texte - </i>French). He also highlights gaps, mainly that the former misses the mark with understanding historical nuance and mainly applies to rich verses, whereas the latter resembles "a sort of bayonet drill" [@wattFirstParagraphAmbassadors1960: 250] , which highlights the inability of the technique to truly understand the depth of a text if one merely looks at its external factors. He then highlights various other developments such as the German's attempt at philology which ultimately lead to the technique of stylistics – an attempt at using linguistics to critically analyse a literary text. All in all, Watt expounds that no one technique is truly able to capture the heart of a text, foregrounding that his analysis is a amalgamation of the various techniques raised thus far, looking at the text through both a micro and macro lens. (I - "low as syntax"; II - "high as ideas"; III - "total literary structure") [@wattFirstParagraphAmbassadors1960: 253]

==

I: "Low as syntax"
 
In the first section, Watt highlights how James' writing evokes a sense of abstractness, where he refers to "mental ideas" rather than "concrete and particular subjects". In doing so, James is thus able to concurrently handle various objects and events, while also allowing for an undisturbed (?) view of events. Watt posits that by writing in this manner, James thus allows for "a community of three minds", that is, the text is filtered through Strether's ("the characters' awareness of events"), James' ("the narrator's seeing of them"), and the reader's ("our own trailing perception of the relation between these two") perspectives of the events. More curiously, that the events the narrative talks about are consistently shifting between time and space, made possible by James' abstraction and generalisation of time and space. All of these effects (three frames of perspective, consistently shifting narrative within time and space) serve to highlight James' attempt to posit that "there are no negatives in nature but only in the human consciousness". To prove this, Watt raises various examples, looking at the text in a very micro manner. Such examples include Watt's analysis of the quantity and case-form of verbs, nouns, conjunctions, as well as James' avoidance of personal pronouns and adjectives as well as the presence of many negatives and near-negatives. These techniques allow James to avoid the usage of direct-reported speech which would superimpose Strether's "consciousness into the narrative" instead of allowing for analysis by the reader.

==

II: "high as ideas"

 Further, by generalising, Watt argues that even in small and minor individual experiences, James highlights the interconnectedness of "general moral, social and historical relations" (TO CITE) and thus, James is able to "relate every \[...] moment of life to the full complexity of its circumambient conditions". (TO CITE) Watt argues that James' diction and style are purposeful and clearely bringsup his messaging. Watt brings up various examples of diction in clauses/sentences where they appear to be mistakes or grammatically confusing, positing specific effects of James' writing he wishes to evoke, such as resonance/emphasis on a certain word or idea.

Watt further argues that this "abstraction" idea underscores that James tone in the novel is one of irony, or as Watt argues, "humourous\[ness]" (TO CITE). Here, Wa

> The Ambassadors

>> The Ambassadors is a 1903 novel by Henry James, originally published as a serial in the North American Review. The novel is a dark comedy which follows the trip of protagonist Lewis Lambert Strether to Paris, France to bring Chad Newsome, the son of his widowed fiancée, Mrs Newsome, back to the family business.

> a piece of literature is not necessarily violated if we give systematic attention to such matters as its author, its historical setting, and the formal properties of its language.  Practical Criticism, on the other hand, as it was developed at Cambridge by I. A. Richards, continues the tradition of the British Empiricists. Inductive rather than deductive, it makes a point of excluding linguistic and historical considerations, so as to derive—in appearance at least—all the literary values of a work empirically from the words on the page.

> Its air of objectivity confers a spurious authority on a process that is often only a rationalisation of an unexamined judgment, and that must always be to some extent subjective; its exclusion of historical factors seems to authorise a more general anti-historicism; and—though this objection is perhaps less generally accepted—it contains an inherent critical bias in the assumption that the part is a complete enough reflection of the literary whole to be profitably appreciated and discussed in isolation from its context

> Strether's first question, when he reached the hotel, was about his friend; yet on his learning that Waymarsh was apparently not to arrive till evening he was not wholly disconcerted. A telegram from him bespeaking a room 'only 5 if not noisy', reply paid, was produced for the inquirer at the office, so that the understanding they should meet at Chester rather than at Liverpool remained to that extent sound. The same secret principle, however, that had prompted Strether not absolutely to desire Waymarsh's 10 presence at the dock, that had led him thus to postpone for a few hours his enjoyment of it, now operated to make him feel he could still wait without disappointment. They would dine together at the worst, and, with all respect to dear old Waymarsh—if not even, for that matter, to him15 self—there was little fear that in the sequel they shouldn't see enough of each other. The principle I have just mentioned as operating had been, with the most newly disembarked of the two men, wholly instinctive—the fruit of a sharp sense that, delightful as it would be to find him20 self looking, after so much separation, into his comrade's face, his business would be a trifle bungled should he simply arrange for this countenance to present itself to the nearing steamer as the first 'note' of Europe. Mixed with everything was the apprehension, already, on Strether's 25 part, that it would, at best, throughout, prove the note of Europe in quite a sufficient degree.8

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> James's late prose style is characteristically abstract; more explicitly, that the main grammatical subjects are very often nouns for mental ideas, 'question', 'principle', etc.; and that the verbs—because they are mainly used either non-transitively, or in infinitive, participial and gcrundial forms,—tend to express states of being rather than particular finite actions affecting objects.

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> instead of a sheer stated event, we get a very special view of it; the mere fact that actuality has been digested into reported speech—the question 'was about his friend'—involves a narrator to do the job, to interpret the action, and also a presumed audience that he does it for: and by implication, the heat of the action itself must have cooled off somewhat for the translation and analysis of the events into this form of statement to have had time to occur.

>> instead of just narrating the event itself, james' style allows us a unique perspective into it,
>> if the text was reported, it would not be of Strether's accord, but that it would be of the narator who not only tells of the story, but in doing so, has to interpret it FOR an audience that he presumes will be listening

>> and at the same time, by reporting the speech verbatim, it signifies that it has past.


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> making the subject of the sentence 'question' rather than 'he', has the effect of subordinating the particular actor, and therefore the particular act, to a much more general perspective: mental rather than physical, and subjective rather than objective

>> Looking at the syntax of the sentence - subject is question - which generalises BOTH the actor and the act of questioning


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> disliked the 'mere platitude of statement' involved in first-person narrative; partly, presumably, because it would merge Strether's consciousness into the narrative, and not isolate it for the reader's inspection. For such isolation, a more expository method is needed: no confusion of subject and object, as in first-person narration, but a narrator forcing the reader to pay attention to James's primary objective—Strether's mental and subjective state.

>> by merely stating what had happened, we get explicit insight into Strether's "consciousness", which "merges it into the narrative", preventing further analysis into the subject
>> 
>> but by making things more general, James' forces the reader to pay attention to his consciousness


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> here are always at least three levels of development—all of them subjective: the characters' awareness of events: the narrator's seeing of them; and our own trailing perception of the relation between these two.


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> This abundance of negatives has no doubt several functions: it enacts Strether's tendency to hesitation and qualification; it puts the reader into the right judicial frame of mind; and it has the further effect of subordinating concrete events to their mental reflection; 'Waymarsh was not to arrive', for example, is not a concrete statement of a physical event: it is subjective—because it implies an expectation in Strether's mind (which was not fulfilled); and it has an abstract quality—because while Waymarsh's arriving would be particular and physical, his not arriving is an idea, a non-action.

>> 
>> - intransitive verbs ('the understanding ... remained... sound'; 'the... principle... operated to)
>> 
>> Indicative verbs > transitive verbs (more than double)
>> - further substantiated by frequent infinitive, participial and gerundial cases of the transitive verbs --> the active nature of the SBO sequence thus is undermined/abate
>> 
>> 2. abstract nouns as subjects of clauses ('question'; 'understanding'; 'the same secret principle'; 'the principle'; 'his business'
>> =(E)=> "Jame's late prose style is characteristically abstract" since the subject nouns used refer to mental ideas, rather than of the concrete and particular subjects and that the use of non-transitive verbs, or if used transitively, in infinitive, participal and gerundial cases, expresses state of being  rather than finite actions affecting objects
>> The eventual meaning of this is that James can thus deal w various objects and events
>> 
>> much use of 'that', avoidance of personal pronouns and adjectives, presence of many negatives and near-negatives
>> 
>> the reason that James uses a more general way of writing, is to allow for an undisturbed (?) view of the event. by using direct, reported speech, the event is filtered through the interpretation of a narrator for a presumed audiance, thus positing that the event is past. direct, reported speech, superimposes Strether's character onto the narrative, instead of allowing for analysis by the reader.

> He may be classed as an 'Impressionist', concerned, that is, to show not so much the events themselves, but the impressions which they make on the characters. But James's continual need to generalise and place and order, combined with his absolute demand for a point of view that would be plastic enough to allow him freedom for the formal 't' of the novelists' craft, eventually involved him in a very idiosyncratic kind of multiple Impressionism: idiosyncratic because the dual presence of Strether's consciousness and of that of the narrator, who translates what he sees there into more general terms, makes the narrative point of view both intensely individual and yet ultimately social.

>> meaning #2: because James' consistently generalises, as well as demands for a "plastic" POV (the multiple frames of reference) - he falls under a "very idiosyncratic kind of multiple Impressionism"), which "makes the narrative point of view both intensely individual and yet ultimately social"


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> abstractness and indirection of James's style are essentially the result of this characteristic multiplicity of his vision.


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> the defence of the Jamesian habit of mind must surely be that what the human vision shares with that of animals is presumably the perception of concrete images, not the power to conceive universals: such was Aristotle's notion or man's distinguishing capacity. The universals in the present context are presumably the awareness that behind every petty individual circumstance there ramifies an endless network of general moral, social and historical relations. Henry James's style can therefore be seen as a supremely civilised effort to relate every event and every moment of life to the full complexity of its circumambient conditions.

>> James' abstractness comes from his ability to see multiple things happening at once. that as humans our power is to concieve universals (generalisations) rather than just percieve concret happenings. in concieving universals, James highlights that in even small and minor indiivudal experiences/actions, it points to "an endless network of general moral, social and historical relations" and thus this enables James to "relate every event and every moment of life to the full complexity of its circumambient conditions".


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> Most newly disembarked' means something rather different from 'more newly disembarked'. James, it may be surmised, did not want to compare the recency of the two men's arrival, but to inform us that Strether's arrival was 'very' or as we might say, 'most' recent; the use of the superlative also had the advantage of suggesting the long and fateful tradition of transatlantic disembarcations in general


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>

> everberates through 'already', ('much more to come later') 'on Strether's part' ('even he knows') and 'at best' ('the worst has been envisaged, too'); but it is the final collapse of the terse rhythm of the parenthesis that isolates the rather awkwardly placed 'throughout', and thus enables James to sound the fine full fatal note; there is no limit to die poignant eloquence of 'throughout'. It was this effect, of course, which dictated the preceding inversion which places 'apprehension' not at the start of die sentence, but in the middle where, largely freed from its syntactical nexus, it may be directly exposed to its salvos of qualification.

>> that is, that although James' abstractions are difficult to udnerstand, it doesnt confound clarity, and that James' diction and writing are purposeful and clearly carries his messaging.

> In structure, to begin with, the six sentences form three groups of two: each pair of them gives one aspect of Strether's delay; and they are arranged in an ascending order of complication so that the fifth sentence—72 words—is almost twice as long as any other, and is succeeded by the final sentence, the punch line, which is noticeably the shortest—26 words.

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> in this particular paragraph Strether's dilemma is developed in such a way that we feel for him even more than we smile at him. This balance of intention, I think, probably explains why James keeps his irony in such a low key: we must be aware of Strether's 'secret' ambivalence towards Waymarsh, but not to the point that his unawareness of it would verge on fatuity; and our controlling sympathy for the causes of Strether's ambivalence turns what might have been irony into something closer to what Constance Rourke characterises as James's typical 'low-keyed humor of defeat' (American Humor, 1931).

> the likeness of the basic structural technique of the paragraph to that of the funny story—the incremental involvement in an endemic human perplexity which can only be resolved by laughter's final acceptance or contradiction and absurdity. We don't, in the end, see Strether's probing hesitations mainly as an ironic indication by James of mankind's general mudolement; we find it, increasingly, a touching example of how, despite all their inevitable incongruities and shortcomings, human ties remain only, but still, human.

> James has carefully avoided giving us the usual retrospective beginning, that pile of details which he scornfully termed a 'mere seated mass of information'. All the details are scrupulously presented as reflections from the novel's essential centre—the narrator's patterning of the ideas going forwards and backwards in Strether's mind. Of course, this initially makes the novel more difficult, because what we probably think of as primary—event and its setting—is subordinated to what James thinks is—the mental drama of the hero's consciousness, which, of course, is not told but shown: sccnically dramatised. At the same time, by selecting thoughts and events which are representative of the book as a whole, and narrating them with an abstractness which suggests their larger import, James introduces the most general themes of the novel.

>> James avoids dumping a bunch of information at the onset of the novel, instead highlighting everything through what he feels is most important ("the mental drama of the hero's consciousness") throught the frame of Strether's thoughts ("the narrator's patterning of the ideas ... in Strether's mind"). In selecting these information, rather than just blurting out facts of the novel, James' abstractness at the beginning introduces the overall themes of the novel.

> The most obvious and demonstrable features of James's prose style, its vocabulary and syntax, are direct reflections of his attitude to life and his conception of the novel; and these features, like the relation of the paragraph to the rest of the novel, and to other novels, make clear that the notorious idiosyncrasies of Jamesian prose are directly related to the imperatives which led him to develop a narrative texture as richly complicated and as highly organised as that of poetry

> so many levels of meaning and implication are kept in continuous operation; in which the usual introductory exposition of time, place, character, and previous action, are rendered through an immediate immersion in the processes of the hero's mind as he's involved in perplexities which are characteristic of the novel as a whole and which are articulated in a mode of comic development which is essentially that, not only of the following chapter, but of the total structure
