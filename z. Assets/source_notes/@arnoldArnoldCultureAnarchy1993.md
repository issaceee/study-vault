> Also — for our reference during class — this is Arnold's definition of culture in the Preface to the 1869 edition of _Culture and Anarchy_:
> 
> The whole scope of the essay is to recommend culture as the great help out of our present difficulties; ==culture being a pursuit of our total perfection by means of getting to know, on all the matters which most concern us, the best which has been thought and said in the world, and, through this knowledge, turning a stream of fresh and free thought upon our stock notions and habits, which we now follow staunchly but mechanically, vainly imagining that there is a virtue in following them staunchly which makes up for the mischief of following them mechanically.== This, and this alone, is the scope of the following essay. I say again here, what I have said in the pages which follow, that from the faults and weaknesses of bookmen a notion of something bookish, pedantic, and futile has got itself more or less connected with the word culture, and that it is a pity we cannot use a word more perfectly free from all shadow of reproach. And yet, futile as are many bookmen, and helpless as books and reading often prove for bringing nearer to perfection those who [ix] use them, one must, I think, be struck more and more, the longer one lives, to find how much, in our present society, a man's life of each day depends for its solidity and value on whether he reads during that day, and, far more still, on what he reads during it. More and more he who examines himself will find the difference it makes to him, at the end of any given day, whether or no he has pursued his avocations throughout it without reading at all; and whether or no, having read something, he has read the newspapers only. This, however, is a matter for each man's private conscience and experience. If a man without books or reading, or reading nothing but his letters and the newspapers, gets nevertheless a fresh and free play of the best thoughts upon his stock notions and habits, he has got culture. He has got that for which we prize and recommend culture; he has got that which at the present moment we seek culture that it may give us. This inward operation is the very life and essence of culture, as we conceive it.


Arnold argues that detractors think that culture is unintellactual and unacademic - just mere simple curiosuty or done out of vanity or exclusiveness
for the English, culture is always tainted with a sense ofunintellectual and frivolous activity (curiousity)
while there is frivolous curiosity, there is also a sense of curiosity in which one strives to learn for learning sake, which requires effort and contrary to the frivolous perspective
in addition to the scientific motive of curiosity, culture is also motivated socially - in our want to make things better for others and society as a whole, perfecting our world
Culture is different from Religion in the sense that Culture acts on both curiosity and the strive of perfection. where the latter strives to act rather than think, Culture balances both aspects as it understands that "acting and instituting are of little use, unless we know how and what we ought to act and to institute"
this culture needs to be situated within a period of intellectual paradigm change, in which we are discovering new things every day
in this new parradigm, our previous rules and routines are broken done, allowing for a this strive for culture, the strive for perfection.

> so there is certainly a curiosity, —a desire after the things of the mind simply for their own sakes and for the pleasure of seeing them as they are,—which is, in an intelligent being, natural and laudable. Nay, and the very desire to see things as they are implies a balance and regulation of mind which is not often attained without fruitful effort, and which is the very opposite of the blind and diseased impulse of mind which is what we mean to blame when we blame curiosity

>> while there is frivolous curiosity, there is also a sense of curiosity in which one strives to learn for learning sake, which requires effort and contrary to the frivolous perspective

> There is a view in which all the love of our neighbour, the impulses towards action, help, and beneficence, the desire for removing human error, clearing human confusion, and diminishing human misery, the noble aspiration to leave the world better and happier than we found it,motives eminently such as are called social,—come in as part of the grounds of culture, and the main and pre-eminent part. Culture is then properly described not as having its origin in curiosity, but as having its origin in the love of perfection; it is a study ofperfectio

>> in addition to the scientific motive of curiosity, culture is also motivated socially - in our want to make things better for others and society as a whole, perfecting our world

> And knowing that no action or institution can be salutary and stable which is not based on reason and the will of God, it is not so bent on acting and instituting, even with the great aim of diminishing human error and misery ever before its thoughts, but that it can remember that acting and instituting are of little use, unless we know how and what we ought to act and to institute.

>> Culture is different from Religion in the sense that Culture acts on both curiosity and the strive of perfection. where the latter strives to act rather than think, Culture balances both aspects as it understands that "acting and instituting are of little use, unless we know how and what we ought to act and to institute"

> But it needs times of faith and ardour, times when the intellectual horizon is opening and widening all round us, to flourish in. And is not the close and bounded intellectual horizon within which we have long lived and moved now lifting up, and are not new lights finding free passage to shine in upon us?

>> this culture needs to be situated within a period of intellectual paradigm change, in which we are discovering new things every day


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> ut now the iron force of adhesion to the old routine,—social, political, religious,—has wonderfully yielded; the iron force of exclusion of all which is new has wonderfully yielded.

> the moment it is regarded not solely as the endeavour to see things as they are, to draw towards a knowledge of the universal order which seems to be intended and aimed at in the world, and which it is a man's happiness to go along with or his misery to go counter to,—to learn, in short, the will of God,—the moment, I say, culture is considered not merely as the endeavour to see and learn this, but as the endeavour, also, to make it prevail, the moral, social, and beneficent character of culture becomes manifest.

>> culture is not merely motivated by wwanting to see and learn about new things, but to make society prevail

> Religion says: The kingdom of God is within you; and culture, in like manner, places human perfection in an internal condition, in  61  https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511802072.008 Published online by Cambridge University Press Culture and Anarchy  the growth and predominance of our humanity proper, as distinguished from our animality. It places it in the ever-increasing efficacy and in the general harmonious expansion of those gifts of thought and feeling, which make the peculiar dignity, wealth, and happiness of human nature.

>> culture says that humanity prevails when all aspects of ours are harmonious


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> And because men are all members of one great whole, and the sympathy which is in human nature will not allow one member to be indifferent to the rest or to have a perfect welfare independent of the rest, the expansion of our humanity, to suit the idea of perfection which culture forms, must be a general expansion. Perfection, as culture conceives it, is not possible while the individual remains isolated.

>> this harmony must affect everyone - no one can be isolated

> If culture, then, is a study of perfection, and of harmonious perfection, general perfection, and perfection which consists in becoming something rather than in having something, in an inward condition of the mind and spirit, not in an outward set of circumstances,—it is clear that culture, instead of being the frivolous and useless thing  d Arnold is quoting from his .4 French Eton (1864).  62  https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511802072.008 Published online by Cambridge University Press Sweetness and Light  which Mr. Bright, and Mr. Frederic Harrison, and many other Liberals are apt to call it, has a very important function to fulfil for mankind


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> The idea of perfection as an inward condition of the mind and spirit is at variance with the mechanical and material civilisation in esteem with us, and nowhere, as I have said, so much in esteem as with us. The idea of perfection as a general expansion of the human family is at variance with our strong individualism, our hatred of all limits to the unrestrained swing of the individual's personality, our maxim of "every man for himself." Above all, the idea of perfection as a harmonious expansion of human nature is at variance with our want of flexibility, with our inaptitude for seeing more than one side of a thing, with our intense energetic absorption in the particular pursuit we happen to be following.

> Again and again I have insisted how those are the happy moments of humanity, how those are the marking epochs of a people's life, how those are the flowering times for literature and art and all the creative power of genius, when there is a national glow of life and thought, when the whole of society is in the fullest measure permeated by thought, sensible to beauty, intelligent and alive.

> It does not try to teach down to the level of inferior classes; it does not try to win them for this or that sect of its own, with ready-made judgments and watchwords. It seeks to do away with classes; to make the best that has been thought and known in the world current everywhere; to make all men live in an atmosphere of sweetness and light, where they may use ideas, as it uses them itself, freely,—nourished, and not bound by them.

> passion for diffusing, for making prevail, for carrying from one end of society to the other, the best knowledge, the best ideas of their time; who have laboured to divest knowledge of all that was harsh, uncouth, difficult, abstract, professional, exclusive; to humanise it, to make it efficient outside the clique of the cultivated and learned, yet still remaining the best knowledge and thought of the time, and a true source, therefore, of sweetness and light.
