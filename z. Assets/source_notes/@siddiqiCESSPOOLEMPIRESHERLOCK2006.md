Siddiqi charts the role of the Empire in Doyle's detective fiction (Yumna Siddiqi, “The Cesspool of Empire: Sherlock Holmes and the Return of the Repressed,” *Victorian Literature and Culture* 34.1 [2006]: 233–247, Cambridge UP).

1. characters in Doyle often include returned colonialists who have benefitted from their colonial experiences. in england, these refreshed identities stand in for the spoils of imperialism — cashing out abroad, cashing in at home — and they re-seed landed gentry habits (country gentleman mode). think trevor in “gloria scott,” heirs in *hound*, barclay, even watson as a respectable returnee.

2. but there’s also a second faction of returners — the imperial lumpen: ruined soldiers, drifters, blackmailers, illegitimate kin — the “whites” new imperialism has failed. they shadow the respectable returnee, sometimes foil him, sometimes bring retribution (the colonial past coming home to roost): hudson in “gloria scott”; the bushranger connection in “boscombe valley”; jonathan small in *sign of four*; henry wood in “the crooked man”; the poor south american relation in *hound*.

   2.1. this latter caste is exactly the people empire both needed and felt ashamed of — “poor whites” who did the dirty work (overseers, petty soldiers, clerks), buffering elite colonials from the colonised. when surplus or fallen, they’re repatriated, institutionalised, or criminalised (vagrancy acts). embarrassment + usefulness in one unstable class.

3. the doubling (respectable vs lumpen) is written onto bodies. the down-and-out returnee’s body is often disfigured or “off”: small’s wooden leg; wood’s warped frame; emsworth’s “blanched” skin; stapleton’s uncanny likeness. these bodies stage a “double self” — the unhomely englishman who can’t fully re-enter the nation.

   3.1. theory note (kept light): the abject/uncanny helps name what these bodies do — they disturb borders (self/nation, centre/periphery). the ravaged returnee reminds the national body it isn’t whole; his presence troubles late-imperial order (Kristeva; Mary Douglas).

   3.2. crucial displacement: native peoples are often elided; the violence of empire is symbolically shifted onto poor white bodies — the “return of the repressed” at home.

4. london = the sump. watson calls it “that great cesspool… of empire,” and he’s the borderline case: wounded, unemployed, drifting — then medically and socially rehabilitated into respectability (doctor, marriage, partnership with holmes). even so, the wound “wanders,” so the reintegration is never fully clean.

5. race slides across class: poor whites are coded as not-quite-white (browned, blanched, partnered with racialised companions; non-metropolitan speech). siddiqi: their “questionable whiteness” blurs the european/native line.

6. doyle in public = pro-empire (civilising mission, kitchener, imperial clubs). the fiction, though, keeps leaking misgivings: disease, guilt, the uneasy afterlives of campaigns (*“blanched soldier”* etc.). both notes can be true at once.

7. respectable returnees don’t just buy houses; they re-energise “old england” with imperial cash (country gentleman restoration). the neat pairing matters: one returns rich, one returns ruined — same route, different fate.

8. genre work (why detective fiction fits this): the form promises juridical closure (identify culprit → purge community → restore order). that overlay can displace structural problems onto a single body (the criminal), which helps the community feel cleansed. but in doyle’s imperial tales the moral economy is messy: sometimes the respectable are corrupt; sometimes the outcast isn’t rehabilitated; sometimes the ending is just open (hudson vanishes). closure strains; remainder stays.

9. key pattern to watch in passages (fast cues):
   – pronouns + vantage (“we,” survey tones).  
   – lists + imported objects (maps, tea, guns) that aestheticise extraction.  
   – bodily tags (color, limp, scar) doing ideological work.  
   – domestic spaces invaded by colonial pasts (the house as stage for return).  
   – endings that try to tidy but can’t quite (ambiguity, vanished culprits, uneasy restorations).

10. bottom line as thesis (in my words): the returnee figure is a portable device for national self-exposure. respectable returners re-inscribe hierarchy at home; lumpen returners expose the cracks (class, race, health) that the imperial story tries to paper over. in siddiqi’s terms, the “flotsam and jetsam” of empire keeps washing up, troubling the fiction of a whole national body.

11. side-note on administration + policy (for context on 2.1 if needed): vagrancy acts targeted destitute europeans; repatriation/institutions used to maintain the facade of a homogenous ruling race. yet the same poor whites could be licensed buffers and do the “dirty work.” ambiguous utility → lingering threat.

12. one more small reading move i’ll keep: if natives are offstage, treat the *elision itself* as evidence (who is allowed to appear? whose injuries “count”?). the repeated absence matters as much as the grotesque returnee who *is* allowed to take up space.

> New Imperialism

>> <b>New Imperialism</b> characterizes a period of colonial expansionby European powers, the United States, and Japan during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<sup>[1]</sup> The period featured an unprecedented pursuit of overseas territorial acquisitions. At the time, states focused on building their empires with new technological advances and developments, expanding their territory through conquest, and exploiting the resources of the subjugated countries. During the era of New Imperialism, the European powers (and Japan) individually conquered almost all of Africa and parts of Asia. The new wave of imperialism reflected ongoing rivalries among the great powers, the economic desire for new resources and markets, and a "civilizing mission" ethos. Many of the colonies established during this era gained independence during the era of decolonization that followed World War II.

It was from such useful positions that they slid into destitution and vagrancy.
