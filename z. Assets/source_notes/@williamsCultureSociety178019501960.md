> INTRODUCTION


  

<mark style="background-color:#cccccc">Highlight</mark>
> Industry, before this period, was a  name for a particular human attribute, which could be  paraphrased as 'skill, assiduity, perseverance, diligence*. This use of industry of course survives. But, in the last  decades of the eighteenth century, industry came also to mean something else; it became a collective word for our  manufacturing and productive institutions, and for their  general activities


  

<mark style="background-color:#cccccc">Highlight</mark>
> emocracy  ceased to be a mere literary word, and became part of  the political vocabulary.1


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> great majority of these examples show the word  being used unfavourably: in close relation with the hated  Jacobinism, or with the familiar mob-rule.

<mark style="background-color:#cccccc">Highlight</mark>
> An art had formerly been any  human skill; but Art, now, signified a particular group of skills, th 'imaginative* or 'creative* arts. Artist had meant XIV INTRODUCTION  a skilled person, as had artisan; but artist now referred to  these selected skills alone. Further, and most significantly,  Art came to stand for a special kind of truth, 'imaginative truth*, and artist for a special kind of person, as the words  artistic and artistical, to describe human beings, new in the  18403, show


  

<mark style="background-color:#cccccc">Highlight</mark>
> But this latter use, which had  usually been a culture of something, was changed, in the  nineteenth century, to culture as such, a thing in itself. It  came to mean, first, 'a general state or habit of the mind',  having close relations with the idea of human perfection.  Second, it came to mean 'the general state of intellectual  development, in a society as a whole'. Third, it came to mean 'the general body of the arts'. Fourth, later in the  century, it came to mean *a whole way of life, material, intellectual and spiritual'. It came also, as we know, to  be a word which often provoked either hostility or em  barrassment.


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> the emergence of culture as an abstraction and an  absolute: an emergence which, in a very complex way,  merges two general responses first, the recognition of the practical separation of certain moral and intellectual activi  ties from the driven impetus of a new kind of society; sec  ond, the emphasis of these activities, as a court of human  appeal, to be set over the processes of practical social judge ment and yet to offer itself as a mitigating and rallying  alternative. But, in both these senses, culture was not a  response to the new methods of production, the new Industvy, alone.


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> many words  are necessary, in order, first, to bring out and convey what is surely no difficult idea in itself that of the cul  tivation of the intellect as an end; next, in order to recommend what surely is no unreasonable object; and lastly, to describe and realize to the mind the particu  lar perfection in which that object consists.

> the harmonious development of those qualities and  faculties that characterize our humanity.


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> 'we must educate our masters'. Macaulay, characteristically, argued that the 'ignorance* of the 'common people* was a danger to  property, and that therefore their education was necessary.  Carlyle, on the other hand, had rejected any argument for education based on grounds of social expediency: 'as if . . .  the first function (of) a government were not . . .to impart  the gift of thinking'.


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> but it was not fear for our property and  position; it was the fear that we were not discharging  the responsibilities, greater than those which rank or property imposes, that our education laid upon us.


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>

> recommend culture as the great help out of our pres  ent difficulties; culture being a pursuit of our total per fection by means of getting to know, on all the matters  which most concern us, the best which has been  thought and said in the world; and, through this  knowledge, turning a stream of fresh and free thought upon our stock notions and habits, which we now fol  low staunchly but mechanically, vainly imagining that there is a virtue in following them staunchly which  makes up for the mischief of following them me  chanically. 1

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> The damage done by the stock notion  of Wealth is its narrowing of human ideals to a single end,  which is really only a means. The question, certainly, is what quality of life the wealth is used to sustain. Arnold  asked this question, but included in his answer a stock re  action to 'the vulgar' which is surely vulgar in itself.


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> One might say that the  light penetrates, but that it is hardly accompanied by sweetness. The literary method, rather, is that of a soured  romanticism, of which we have had sufficient examples in  the stock notions about 'Subtopia' in our own day.

> he lived through a period in which the freedom of one group of people to do as they  liked was being challenged by that much larger group who were being *done by as others liked'


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> The aristocracy  (Barbarians) were, as a class, useless, because their char acteristic virtues were those created by the business of de  fending the status quo. Their very vigour in this defence  made them inaccessible to the free play of new ideas, on  which light and authority' must depend. The middle classes (Philistines) were also useless, because of their at  tachment to an external civilization. Their faith in 'machin  ery' (Wealth, Industry, Production, Progress) and in in dividual success denied, respectively, the ^harmonious* and  the 'general* pursuit of perfection. As for the working classes (Populace), they either shared with the middle classes the  attachment to external civilization, wishing only to become  Philistine as quickly as possible; or else they were merely degraded and brutal, the repository of darkness rather than  of light.


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> The classes were the embodiment of our ordinary  selves; to embody our best self we must create a State. But  by what means, and through what persons? Arnold's an swer depends on what he called the 'remnant'.


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> that the State  itself must be the principal agent through which, the State  as a 'centre of authority and fight' is to be created. Yet the  existing State, loaded with such an agency, is in fact, on  Arnold's showing, subject to the deadlock of the existing  and inadequate social classes.


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> The aristocracy uses the  power and dignity of the State as an instrument of protec  tion of its own privileges. The middle ckss, reacting against  this, seeks only to diminish State power, and to leave per  fection to those 'simple natural laws' which somehow arise  out of unregulated individual activity.


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> For Arnold to confuse the particular, temporary or  dering of interests, which was indeed being threatened,  with human society as such, is the confusion which else  where he so clearly analysed: the confusion between 'ma  chinery' and 'purpose'. The existing 'framework of society'  is always 'machinery'. Arnold, who found it in so many ways so inadequate, should have known that this was so;  and restrained his 'right reason' from the talk of 'fire and  strength'. He is, indeed, ready for change. He looks forward 'cheerfully and hopefully' to a 'revolution by due course of  law'.


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> hen the emphasis on State power is so great, any con fusion between that ideal State which is the agent of per  fection, and this actual State which embodies particular  powers and interests, becomes dangerous and really dis  abling.


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> Culture is right knowing and right doing;  a process and not an absolute. This, indeed, is Arnold's  doctrine. But his emphasis in detail is so much on the im  portance of knowing, and so little on the importance of doing, that Culture at times seems very Hke the Dissenters*  Salvation: a thing to secure first, to which all else will then  be added

> urke rested on an existing society, and on a faith.  Coleridge drew nourishment, in a period of transition, from the values known from the old kind of society, and again 138 CULTUBE AND SOCIETY 1780-1950  from a faith. Newman, more certainly than either, based  tils thinking on a convinced experience of the divine order,  Arnold learned from them, but he had learned, also, from  the reformers who rejected the old kind of society and from  the thinkers who had asserted, against the claims of the  divine order, the supremacy of human reason


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> Perfection will never be reached; but to recognize a  period of transformation when it comes, and to adapt  themselves honestly and rationally to its laws, is per haps the nearest approach to perfection of which men and nations are capable. No habits or attachments  should prevent their trying to do this; nor indeed, in  the long run, can they. Human thought, which made  all institutions, inevitably saps them, resting only in that which is absolute and eternal.89


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> He had admitted reason as the critic and de  stroyer of institutions, and so could not rest on the tradi tional society which nourished Burke. He had admitted reason *human thought* as the maker of institutions, and thus could not see the progress of civil society as the work  ing of a divine intention.


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> ulture became the final critic of  institutions, and the process of replacement and betterment, yet it was also, at root, beyond institutions
