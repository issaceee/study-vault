"American romanticism as a movement of dissent"
- romantic writers sought to write against the "emergent order's rationalistic, calculating outlook, its uprooting of traditional structures, and its relentless monetizing of human relations."
- “Business culture was anathema to self-reliance because it placed so much importance on how one appeared to others” (Gilmore, 1988, p. 6) --> Emerson

- reduction of literature to a commodity
	- “Publishing had become an industry, and the writer a producer of commodities for the literary rnarketpla~” (Gilmore, 1988, p. 4)
	- “People and their surroundings were brought under the dominion of exchange, and all transactions, including those between the author and his readers, were turned into money transactions” (Gilmore, 1988, p. 4)

	- Romantic writers “expressed resentment at the reading public whose preferences governed the market” (Gilmore, 1988, p. 6)
		- there is a sense here that inherent literary value and quality is not being *seen*
		- “A distinction was often drawn between the vulgar mass and a more discriminating audience.” (Gilmore, 1988, p. 6)
		- “For Melville, the crucial division was between the enlightened "people" and the imperceptive "public," the latter being a monster "with the head of a jackass, the body of a baboon, and the tail of a scorpion."” (Gilmore, 1988, p. 6)
	- contrast between the success of domestic novels written by women which commanded the attention and enthusiasm of antebellum public
		- “If the "feminine fifties," as this decade has been called, represented a triumph of the mass market, the celebration was not one in which the romantic artists shared” (Gilmore, 1988, p. 7)

	- “While they were harshly critical of the new economic order, they were also strongly drawn to what they saw as the positive effects of commerce, and they were all willing, at least for a time, to accommodate themselves to the imperatives of writing for the mass public. They fought out in their careers and art the question of the market's merits and liabilities.” (Gilmore, 1988, p. 8)
	- “The tension or doubleness in the romantics' response to the marketplace can also be seen in their equivocal feelings about popularity.” (Gilmore, 1988, p. 9)

	
	“Those who pretend that authors have no interest in being well paid are actually contributing to the deterioration of literature, for if writings can be procured for little or nothing, it will only be a matter of time before cheapness replaces merit as the object of publishers” (Gilmore, 1988, p. 55)
	- Nevertheless, there are those who argue that instead of literature deteoriating, in such a market environment, writing needs monetary value so that we can value writers and so that publishers value litearry value over monetary value

- Marketplace as developing "doubleness" in Antebellum literature
	- “Richard Chase, who developed Tocqueville's hints into a seminal thesis about t**he American romance as a genre of irreconcilable opposites**. Chase proposed several explanations for the dualism of the American imagination, among them the weakness of mediating institutions in the nineteenth century and the Manichean sensibility bred by Puritanism. I would supplement Chase's argument by pointing to the growth of the exchange economy as one of the underlying causes of the tensions of American romanticism.” (Gilmore, 1988, p. 11)
	- “It appears that the women's reactions to the literary marketplace were far more complicated than has usually been supposed. What caused them special anguish was their singular position as celebrantsof private domesticlife who occupied the public stage as best-selling authors.30Hawthorne, who was most contemptuous of the female novelists, was also most like them: no conflict disturbed him more than that between his longing for popularity and his dread of having his inner being violated” (Gilmore, 1988, p. 12)


* ==“Traits of romantic art that arise out of antagonism toward the market system prove upon closer inspection to replicate the very conditions against which they protest.” (Gilmore, 1988, p. 12)==
	* “But it was precisely because of the thwarting of such hopes that the classic nineteenth-century works acquired their distinctive qualities. Disappointment impelled the romantics toward textual strategiesof difficulty and concealment, causing them to reconstruct in their relations to their audience the alienation they criticized in modern society.” (Gilmore, 1988, p. 13)


## Melville
- “Melville grappled with the vanishing of the human in the commodity form, a phenomenon as relevant for literary artifacts as for the objects of the physical world. H e also wrote about the deepening of class divisions that accompanied the transition from a household to a rationalized economy. The chapters on Melville contain an implicit argument that the market develops historically from its manifestation in commodities to its role in fostering the social segregation of classes.” (Gilmore, 1988, p. 5)
- “Melville's experience as a common sailor exposed him to the interdependence of working men under the division of labor and convinced him of the power of commerce to break down local prejudices and build trust among different nationalities” (Gilmore, 1988, p. 9)
- “Melville and Hawthorne depended on book sales for their livelihood, and their dismissals of popularity should be weighed against their financial exigencies as well as their commitment to democracy. Melville's dubious distinction between "the public" and "the people" indicates the nature of his dilemma: he vowed "to hate the one and cleave to the other," yet in a democratic society who else constitutes the hated public but precisely the beloved people, the mass of ordinary readers?” (Gilmore, 1988, p. 10)
- “In Moby-Dick he implies that the crucial point of resemblance between the commodity and the symbol is the erasure of the human in both. H e faults Ahab for reading significance into the objects of the world without acknowledging his own complicity in the attribution of meaning to nature. The Captain reproduces in the realm of thought the same mystification of human agency that the capitalist market fosters in the economic sphere.” (Gilmore, 1988, p. 16)
	- Melville here argues that symbolic writing and the technique of symbolism seems to do the exact same thing that the market economy does - erase the human connection
- “attempted to forge some kind of human bond with their readers: to deny or circumvent the impersonal relation of exchange. Melville's companionable first-person narrators, appealing to a circle of fraternal listeners; Hawthorne's dreams of encountering "the one heart and mind of perfect sympathyyy38-these essentially artisanal versions of author-audience relations were fated to be disappointed. Obliged to undertake impersonal market calculationsto survive economically, the two novelists eventually succumbed to the commodifying process. They came to see their readers as adversaries and their books as alienated objects. Especially in the later fictions of Melville,the link between the text and its human maker has virtually disappeared.” (Gilmore, 1988, p. 17)
	- “ On the one side, Melville views the writer as entering into an intimate fellowship with his audience, speaking to them and for them directly in his work. On the other, he regards the writer as a kind of alienatedworker, turning out texts from which his individuality has been erased-like a copyist, for example, or a girl tending a machine in a factory. Thus the "Mosses" essay points not only toward the productive tensions of Moby-Dick b” (Gilmore, 1988, p. 52)


## Moby Dick
- “As the author of the commodity Moby-Dick, Melville also probes the implications of the commercializingof literature. H e holds two antithetical views of how to cope with the exchange relation to his readership. H e oscillates between intimacy and absence as textual practices aimed at survival in a cultural environment where the writer has to sell his head.” (Gilmore, 1988, p. 114)
	- “Ishmael documents in exhaustive detail the production of sperm oil, but oil is only the most conspicuous of commodities in a book where labor, heads, and even the "hills about Boston" (p. 549) are for sale” (Gilmore, 1988, p. 114)


* Idea that the whale is unknowable
	* It fails most obviously because whales in general, and the white whale in particular, frustrate the effort to discover their objective meaning. Throughout his narrative, Ishmael strives to find the "certain significance" supposedly lurking in every natural fact, but his studies yield only the conclusion that the whale eludes his understanding. 
		* For each part of the anatomy that he investigates, he is forced to confess his bafflement: 'The more I consider this mighty tail, the more do I deplore my inability to express it. At times there are gestures in it, which, though they would well grace the hand of a man, remain  wholly inexplicable. . . .Dissect him how I may, then, I go but skin Selling One'sHead  deep; I know him not, and never will" (p. 486)
		* Moby Dick remains similarly inscrutable, his behavior neither confirming or disproving Ahab's interpretation of him as malicious.

- Moby Dick as participating in commodity exchange (but instead of money, it is representation and symbolism)
	* “He is as much involved in an exchange process as his former shipmates, the Pequoifs owners, only in his case he converts objects not into money but into meaning. Like the marketplace, which honors things for their cash value, he ignores nature's uses and beauty in order to focus on what it represents.” (Gilmore, 1988, p. 117)
		* Chapter 99, "The Doubloon," develops the equivalence between monetary and symbolic transactions, underscoring Ahab's connivancein the system of exchange. As currency, the doubloon can buy an infinite variety of items (Flask, for example, would like to spend it for nine hundred and sixty cigars); as a physical object with inscriptions, it elicits an infinite number of interpretations.
			* The sailors who pore over the coin's meaning do in the realm of thought what money enables them to do in the commodity realm

- suppressing and mystification of the human element in the production of meaning
	- Just as man's labor appears to have vanished from the commodity,so the signification that Ahab attributes to objects is not of human making. Moby Dick's malevolence, he maintains in his quarterdeck speech, is an objective fact, a reality out there in the material universe. It exists independently of anything he may think or do. Yet Melville leaves little doubt that Ahab's conception of the whale is generated out of his own subjectivity
		- the Captain "came to identify with [Moby Dick], not only all his bodily woes, but all his  intellectualand spiritualexasperations. . . .He piled upon the whale's white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down"
		- At one point in "The Doubloon" even Ahab realizes that he has been projecting his personal attitudes onto nature. Pausing before the gold coin, he admits that each understanding of its figures reflects the individual observer: "The firm tower, that is Ahab; the volcano, that is Ahab; the courageous, the undaunted, and victorious fowl, that, too, is Ahab; all are Ahab; and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe, which, like a magician's glass, to each and every man in turn but mirrors back his own mysterious self" (p. 551).

commodification
- At the book's heart is the elaboratelydescribed process whereby a living part of nature is transformed into an object of human consumption. Hundreds of pages of dense and often technically detailed prose are devoted to the fashioning of a commodity; the climactic battle with Moby Dick, by contrast, gets a scant three chapters out of a hundred and thirty-five.


- “Melville strives to overcome the dehumanizing effects of commodification on narrative. He is at pains to associate the act of writing with the business of whaling, and to place his own activity as an author as much before the reader as that of the crew. Just as the sailors change the leviathan into a consumable item, so Ishmael proposes to fashion the monster into a text.” (Gilmore, 1988, p. 119)

Books were expensive to manufacture and difficult to distribute widely. Although the system of patronage had never taken root in America, belles-lettres had remained an upper-class or patrician pursuit. Shared interests and knowledge often connected the author and his limited audience. Moreover, writers enjoyed a certain control over their work because they usually hired publishers and paid them a percentage of the profits. Publishers themselves had little incentive to encourage native literature. In the absence of international copyright laws, they were naturally more inclined to reprint foreign books on which they had no obligation to share the profits.
