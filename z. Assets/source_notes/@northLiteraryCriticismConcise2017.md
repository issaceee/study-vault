250 Word Summary

North points out the difference between scholars (historicists/contextualists) and critics (aesthetic educators). To him, a historicist method argues that literary texts are "opportunities for cultural and historical analysis". This method predominate due to left-leaning (Frederick Jamesopn Marxist) individuals who argued that texts were grounded by historical contexts, rather than universals, and professional academic structures in the late 1970s that began favouring research that produced knowledge rather than political intervention or aesthetic knowledge.

Critics however, aim to intervene in culture – to "cultivate aesthetic sensibility". The critic's work is an educational and transformative one, using practical criticism as a tool.

Aesthetic education to North emphasises the cultivation of new ranges of sensibility, modes of subjectivity and capacities for experience. He says that it should change how people percieve, feel and live, insisting that it should enhance capacities for experience, not classification. He insists that they train these skills instead of merely proclaiming values, as they did in the early history of criticism rather than the mid-century.

In shaping how people feel and think, rather than just producing knowledge, it trains people to care differently, supporting social change and inviting intervention. However, mid-century criticism ended up looking like elitism, as it only teaches judgment and ranking the classics (aesthetic education vs idealist aestheticism)

North prefers dividing the 20th century into 3 periods rather than modernism vs postmodernism. This is because it aligns with political-economic transformations which explain why literary scholarship dominated the field.

What are the “historicist/contextualist” methods that define the study of literature in our current historical moment, according to North? Why do these methods predominate today? 

North spends a lot of time distinguishing critics and scholars. What is the difference between these two? Why does North spend so much time focusing on them? What are the politics of scholarship? What are the politics of criticism? 


What does North mean by “aesthetic education”? He doesn’t mean aesthetic judgment, or the elevation of certain works of literature over others; why not? 





At the end of the introduction, North discusses two different ways scholars/thinkers/historians have periodized the twentieth century. What are these two ways? Which way does North think is correct? Why does he devote so much time to this periodization?
