## Formalism
- Literature as a collection of devices (later interrelated elements or functions wihtin the entire textual 'system') 
	- “'Devices' included sound, imagery, rhythm, syntax, metre, rhyme, narrative techniques, in fact the whole stock of formal literary elements; and what all of these elements had in common was their 'estranging' or 'defamiliarizing' effe” (Eagleton, 2005, p. 3)
- what distinguished Literature is that “it 'deformed' ordinary language in various ways.” (Eagleton, 2005, p. 3)
	- The story, as the Formalists would argue, uses 'impeding' or 'retarding' devices to hold our attention; and in literary language, these devices are 'laid. bare'
	- when language is made weird, it forces us to pay more attention to it - how it is constructed and how we engage w the text

- BUT what is a single normal language to which literary language deviates from? different groups of people (across classes, contexts) speak in various manners - 
	- “The idea that there is a single 'normal' language, a common currency shared equally by all members of society, is an illusion. Any actual language consists of a highly complex range of discourses, differentiated according to class, region, gender, status and so on, which can by no means be neatly unified into a single homogeneous linguistic community. One person's norm may be another's deviation” (Eagleton, 2005, p. 4)

- Nevertheless, what the Formalists are arguing for is not a definition of Literature as a whole, but of literariness - what makes a text literary? They acknowledge that what might make a text literary differs across contexts, it is not a permanent, eternal value/quality
	- “The fact that a piece of language was 'estranging' did not guarantee that it was always and everywhere so: it was estranging only against a certain normative linguistic background, and if this altered then the writing might cease to be perceptible as literary.” (Eagleton, 2005, p. 5)
	- ==“For the Formalists, in other words, 'literariness' was a function of the differential relations between one sort of discourse and another; it was not an eternally given property.” (Eagleton, 2005, p. 5)==
	- “They were not out to define 'literature', but 'literariness' - special uses of language, which could be found in 'literary' texts but also in many places outside them” (Eagleton, 2005, p. 5)

- BUT formalists really only really consider all literature as poetry - a single line from a sentence in a novel might not have the literary qualities that differentiate it from a non-literary language - but what makes it literary is the context in which it appears (a novel of which we consider to be literary)
	- “To think of literature as the Formalists do is really to think of all literature as poetry. Significantly, when the Formalists came to consider prose writing, they often simply extended to it the kinds of technique they had used with poetry. But literature is usually judged to contain much besides poetry to include, for example, realist or naturalistic writing which is not linguistically self-conscious or self-exhibiting in any striking way” (Eagleton, 2005, p. 5)
	- ME: if we are merely looking at one sentence outside the context of the book, can we then say it is non-liteary or literary?

> Formalism was essentially the application of linguistics to the study of literature; and because the linguistics in question were of a formal kind, concerned with the structures of language rather than with what one might actually say, the Formalists passed over the analysis of literary 'content' (where one might always be tempted into psychology or sociology) for the study of literary form.
