<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> The founding claim of the form, that which distinguished novelists from libelers, was the insistence that the referent of the text was a generalization about, and not an extratextual, embodied instance of, a ‘‘species.’


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> The novel is thus ‘‘true’’ in its generality even though all of its particulars are merely imaginary

>> The particulars (characters, events) don’t need to be real in order for the general claims (about how people behave, how society works) to be true.
>> 
>> if we are lookign at particulars - novelists might fall into the trap of leading readers into thinking about a specific person, but in creating gerneal imagined people, we can only imagine them as a species of people rather than a specific person (i.e the doctors, the maidens etc.)


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> Novelists took the abstract entity, the species or type, to be the given, the thing-in-the-world referent grounding the form, and conceded that their individuals are imaginary concoctions. At first glance, then, it seems as though the novel as a form asserts not only the cognitive but also the ontological priority of the general over the particular.


  

<mark style="background-color:#6abf69">Agree</mark>
> he special turn it gives empiricist logic by invoking both a knowledge that types are induced from persons in the world and a further awareness that characters are deduced from types.


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> requiring categories to perceive facts but simultaneously requiring facts to create categories.


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> This initial description of the character proceeds from the particular individual, Mr. Brooke, to the general category of persons by which we are to make sense of him: those glutinously indefinite minds enclosing hard grains of habit. The sentence making the transition from character to species begins with the word ‘‘for,’’ signaling that the sentence to follow will explain Mr. Brooke by locating his type in an imputed world that precedes his invention. Then, as soon as the type, or referent, has been described, it seems to want experiential grounding, a want supplied by instancing someone belonging to the same species but sensually available: ‘‘and a man has been seen lax about all his own interests except the retention of his snuffbox.’’ The ‘‘and’’ beginning that clause tells us we are continuing in the reference mode. Of course, it doesn’t matter whether or not such a man has actually been seen, for we aren’t exploring the truth of the narrator’s claims here, only the structure of her rhetoric, which (to repeat by way of summary) assures us that Mr. Brooke is not a copy of the man with the snuffbox but is rather a fictive instance of a class that has such extradiegetic, real instances as the snuffbox clutcher.

>> literary analysis here
>> Gallagher argues here a movement from:
>> 
>> <b>(Real particular)</b> — <b>(General type)</b> — <b>(Fictional particular)</b>


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> A class constructed just to accommodate random exceptions, however, might easily be read as a skeptical commentary on classification.

>> but then she argues that the category that Brooke is pplaced into is a super specific category that doesnt rly have much use...
>> 
>> therefore this lack of usefulness hints at a category that talks about exceptions... - so he defies the class that the narrator builds
>> --> thus "gaps between general types and individuals"


  

<mark style="background-color:#6abf69">Agree</mark>
> both that characters in the fictional world have the ontological ballast of general reference and that there will always be gaps between general types and individuals.


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> Once the physical type is found, the passage teeters for a moment between referencing through the imagined model on the street, who is inside the novel but supposedly outside the fiction, and realizing the character of Mary Garth


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> Indeed, the progression the reader is asked to follow from sighting a Mary to tasting one, from distanced viewing to more intimate sensation, figures the movement from type to fictional particular as, paradoxically, a process of increasing embodiment.

>> whereas here, the argument is more from moving deeper into knowing a person. from that of just distancy to intimacy --> "increasing embodiment"


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> This point needs emphasis because a novel’s realism is often assumed to be a matter of referential fidelity


  

<mark style="background-color:#6abf69">Agree</mark>
> reference and realization appear to be quite distinct, whereas fictionality and realization appear to be identical. Fictional characters may refer to people in the world by conforming to type, but they only resemble people in their nonconformity.


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> n Middlemarch especially she conceives of the plot as driven by the competing needs to adhere to type and to deviate, to mean and to be, to have significance and to become real. There she takes the plight that belongs specifically to novel characters—that they are supposed to illustrate types from which they must depart—and makes it the central dilemma of a life story.


  

<mark style="background-color:#6abf69">Agree</mark>
> Middlemarch’s formal self-consciousness is not just a comment on some fundamental lack at the heart of fictions; it is, rather, a disclosure of their function. The remainder of this essay will be devoted to the proposition that Eliot’s fiction gives us something we might never otherwise experience: a desire to be real.


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> Hence Theresa, oddly, becomes atypical of the category of Theresas; although they are conceived under her rubric, she is useless as a predictor of their destinies.


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> hey oppose the associations in the mind of rural opinion between normalcy and complete foreknowledge: if the superficial provincial mind seeks ordinariness for its predictability, the serious realist seeks it for its uncertainty


  

<mark style="background-color:#6abf69">Agree</mark>
> to convince us that what seems familiar—the process by which people become ordinary—is in fact radically unknown


  

<mark style="background-color:#6abf69">Agree</mark>
> In the ‘‘Prelude’’ to Middlemarch Eliot rouses our desire for fiction by promising to show us just exactly how it is that one does not conform to type. Classification, foreknowledge, and reference are the inevitable framework of the novel, but the dynamic impulse established here is toward fiction, unpredictability, and particular realization


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> Dorothea finds herself trapped inside the consequences of her first mistake, so that the novel segues from the proposition that she might lead ‘‘perhaps only a life of mistakes’’ to the possibility that she could be ‘‘perhaps a tragic failure.’’


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> In short, the details of her affliction force the plot to swerve from its trajectories repeatedly, to be retrieved by other general scenarios, or standard deviations, until the subcategories seem exhausted. Hence, when told in the novel’s ‘‘Finale’’ that ‘‘our daily words and acts are preparing the lives of many Dorotheas,’’ we would be perfectly justified to respond with a question like Pip’s: ‘‘But, George, what is a Dorothea?’’ And by that point, the only truly satisfactory answer should be ‘‘her.’’


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> In short, realizing in others what the narrator calls ‘‘equivalent centers of self ’’ is the supreme ethical act in Eliot’s novels, and when the Dorotheas appear on the other side of the novel’s final triptych, we understand that they might be women who spend their lives in feats of compassionate particularization


  

<mark style="background-color:#6abf69">Agree</mark>
> Eliot’s ethics are preceded and animated by an erotics of particularization


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> Dorothea is liberated from her oppressive sense of duty by learning that her husband had added a humiliating codicil to his will specifying that she would forfeit her inheritance if she married Will Ladislaw.


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> With its language of being stirred by new organs, it indicates the sudden eruption of erotic sensation in Dorothea; indeed, it implies the addition of the very capacity for such sensation, the implanting of unaccustomed vitals. The idea called ‘‘Dorothea’’ is reshaped around a sexual and reproductive core, so that the very notion of her ‘‘species’’ takes on a newly biological meaning.


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> ndicates that Eliot was herself born along by a massive redirection of longing away from disembodied transcendence and toward embodied immanence


  

<mark style="background-color:#6abf69">Agree</mark>
> by adding flesh to spirit


  

<mark style="background-color:#6abf69">Agree</mark>
> Because George Eliot makes us imagine, not an independently living and breathing Dorothea, but instead an idea called Dorothea requiring that we conceive her bodily sensations to make her real, our very organic reality becomes newly desirable. That this desire will always remain partly unfulfilled, for our physicality cannot make us wholly one with ourselves, only increases its intensity. Through Dorotheas, and perhaps in no other way, we can experience a longing for that which simultaneously seems already given as the basis of our being: our incarnate selves.
