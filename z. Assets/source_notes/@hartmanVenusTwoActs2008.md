“Hers is the same fate as every other Black Venus: no one remembered her name or recorded the things she said, or observed that she refused to say anything at all.” (Hartman, 2008, p. 2)
- sentiment of convergence - of a similar expeirence but at the same time of individual experience each having a commonality that it is not her who is writing her story, but of others writing it for her. she cannot speak for herself

“an untimely story told by a failed witness” (Hartman, 2008, p. 2)
- “upon her in exorbitant circumstances that yield no picture of the everyday life, no pathway to her thoughts, no glimpse of the vulnerability of her face or of what looking at such a face might demand.” (Hartman, 2008, p. 2)
- “There are hundreds of thousands of other girls who share her circumstances and these circumstances have generated few stories. And the stories that exist are not about them, but rather about the violence, excess, mendacity, and reason that seized hold of their lives, transformed them into commodities and corpses, and identified them with names tossed-off as insults and crass jokes.” (Hartman, 2008, p. 2)
	- the idea that not only are the women not being talked about, but that even when they do, it is not of them and their stories, but about what happened to them --> transforming them into objects --> therefore unable to truly know who these women are


“committing further violence in my own act of narration” (Hartman, 2008, p. 2)
- the idea that narration itself can be violent on the women (about minimizing/misrepresenting their narrative an effort therefore not representing the owmen as they are - “the purchase or claim of their lives on the present” (Hartman, 2008, p. 2) - a sense of agency and independacne)


** main goal of the paper:
“a story predicated upon impossibility—listening for the unsaid, translating misconstrued words, and refashioning disfigured lives—and intent on achieving an impossible goal: redressing the violence that produced numbers, ciphers, and fragments of discourse, which is as close as we come to a biography of the captive and the enslaved.” (Hartman, 2008, p. 2)
- “how does one rewrite the chronicle of a death foretold and anticipated, as a collective biography of dead subjects, as a counter-history of the human, as the practice of freedom” (Hartman, 2008, p. 3)
- “How can narrative embody life in words and at the same time respect what we cannot know? How does one listen for the groans and cries, the undecipherable songs, the crackle of fire in the cane fields, the laments for the dead, and the shouts of victory, and then assign words to all of it?” (Hartman, 2008, p. 3)
	- "the undecipherable songs" comes with the idea of sorrow songs

“a history of the present strives to illuminate the intimacy of our experience with the lives of the dead, to write our now as it is interrupted by this past, and to imagine a free state, not as the time before captivity or slavery, but rather as the anticipated future of this writing” (Hartman, 2008, p. 4)
- “history has engendered me, because “the knowledge of the other marks me,”13 because of the pain experienced in my encounter with the scraps of the archive, and because of the kinds of stories I have fashioned to bridge the past and the present and to dramatize the production of nothing—empty rooms, and silence, and lives reduced to waste.” (Hartman, 2008, p. 4)

“While the daily record of such abuses, no doubt, constitutes a history of slavery, the more difficult task is to exhume the lives buried under this prose, or rather to accept that Phibba and Dido exist only within the confines of these words, and that this is the manner in which they enter history. ==**The dream is to liberate them from the obscene descriptions that first introduced them to us==.** It is too easy to hate a man like Thistlewood; what is more difficult is to acknowledge as our inheritance the brutal Latin phrases spilling onto the pages of his journals.” (Hartman, 2008, p. 6)


“unimaginable assumes the guise of everyday practice” (Hartman, 2008, p. 6) 
- uncanny beocmes everyday

“The dangers entailed in this endeavor cannot be bracketed or avoided because of the inevitability of the reproduction of such scenes of violence, which define the state of blackness and the life of the ex-slave” (Hartman, 2008, p. 7)

“Narrative restraint, the refusal to fill in the gaps and provide closure, is a requirement of this method, as is the imperative to respect black noise—the shrieks, the moans, the nonsense, and the opacity, which are always in excess of legibility and of the law and which hint at and embody aspirations that are wildly utopian, derelict to capitalism, and antithetical to its attendant discourse of Man.” (Hartman, 2008, p. 12)



In this essay, Saidiya explores the possibility of a new mode of writing that liberates slave women from written narratives that introduce them to us as commodified objects of violence and degradation, instead writing a counter-history of these people, a story of freedom and agency. Saidiya thus gestures towards a writing practice called critical fabulation that labours to "paint as full a picture of the lives of the captives as possible" by speculating the "what could have been"s that are based on the gaps in the archive – "imagin[ing] what cannot be verified". This use of historical context and narrative restraint therefore at once displaces the authorised account, yet at the same time highlights the impossibility of expressing the experience of the enslaved. Nevertheless, this impossibility of representing the impossible (archival absence) must still be embraced as one that "conditions our knowledge of the past and animates our desire for a liberated future" (space of possibility).

1. impossibility of representing enslaved women within the violent epistemology of the archive
	- “There are hundreds of thousands of other girls who share her circumstances and these circumstances have generated few stories. And the stories that exist are not about them, but rather about the violence, excess, mendacity, and reason that seized hold of their lives, transformed them into commodities and corpses, and identified them with names tossed-off as insults and crass jokes.” (Hartman, 2008, p. 2)
		- the idea that not only are the women not being talked about, but that even when they do, it is not of them and their stories, but about what happened to them --> transforming them into objects --> therefore unable to truly know who these women are
	- “committing further violence in my own act of narration” (Hartman, 2008, p. 2)
		- the idea that narration itself can be violent on the women (about minimizing/misrepresenting their narrative an effort therefore not representing the owmen as they are - “the purchase or claim of their lives on the present” (Hartman, 2008, p. 2) - a sense of agency and independacne)
		- self reflexivity

	- BUT this is what animates Hartman's project - failure itself is the method: to write in full awareness of its own limits

2. Critical Fabulation as Ethical Balancing Act
	- speculative practice that both reimagines and refuses to overwrite the silences of the archive
	- ethical balancing act between imagination and restraint
	- ethics of refusal
		- narrative restraint as essential to respecting black noice
		- silence and opacity themselves as forms of resistance
		- not just about giving voice, but listening for the unsaid

3. Collective vs Individual Paradox
	- Venus as a composite figure emblematic of "every other Black Venus" YET insists on impossibility of knowing an individuals full life

4. History of the present
	- not jsut writing ABOUT the past but WITH it - showcasing how afterlife of slavery structures the present
	- “A history of the present strives to illuminate the intimacy of our experience with the lives of the dead” (p. 4).
	- critical fabulation not just as recovery, but as a political and temporal intervention — _bridging the dead and the living._

> s it possible to exceed or negotiate the constitutive limits of the archive? By advancing a series of speculative arguments and exploiting the capacities of the subjunctive (a grammatical mood that expresses doubts, wishes, and possibilities), in fashioning a narrative, which is based upon archival research, and by that I mean a critical reading of the archive that mimes the figurative dimensions of history, I intended both to tell an impossible story and to amplify the impossibility of its telling.

> rather laboring to paint as full a picture of the lives of the captives as possible. This double gesture can be described as straining against the limits of the archive to write a cultural history of the captive, and, at the same time, enacting the impossibility of representing the lives of the captives precisely through the process of narration.
