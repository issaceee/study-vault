250 word Summary:

Gallagher and Greenblatt argue for New Historicism as a way to reconnect literature to historical contexts of the time, rather than as individual works of art appreciated in  isolation. They argue that New Historicism requires different academic lenses, as they reject one singular Cultural identity, for there is an impossibility in defining boundaries that segregate a group of people from others, or a time period from another without encountering overlaps in almost every way. Hence, they posit to focus on particulars not as a reflection of universality, but as an expression of a unique personal historical experience. Another key concept is to look at more than just literature, but other texts as well, from high brow art to low brow literature (eg. gossip) as all these would contribute to a more holistic understanding of the historical experience of a particular time.

In order to demonstrate this, Gallagher and Greenblatt chart the development of the symbolism of the potato in the 18th and 19th century as a symbolism of poverty, compared to that of bread, a symbol of the Christian Eucharist. They reveal how the potato, rather than just being a mere object as materialism suggests, begin to adopt various symbolic meanings (poverty, the Other, excess, risk to the political and economic, capitalist structure). Analysing the potato through anthropological, textual and historical evidence, they prove that ideas of spirituality (mortality vs divinity), the economy (poverty, labour value), the human body (hunger, fertility) and politics (structures, state power, moral order), converge in the potato, providing a comprehensive overview of the 18th and 19th century.

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> One of the recurrent criticisms of new historicism is that it is insufficiently theorized. The .criticism is certainly just, and yet it seems curiously out of touch with the simultaneous fascination with theory and resistance to it that has shaped from · the start our whole attempt to rethink the practice of literary and cultural studies.


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> There is no longer a unitary story, a supreme model of human perfection, that can be securely located in a particular site. Any individual culture, no matter how complex and· elaborate, can express and experience only a narrow range of the options available to the human species as a whole, a species that is inherendythat is, abstracted from any particular historical manifestation of its being-without qualities. "Born almost without instinct," humans are astonishingly malleable; our identity is formed "only through lifelong training toward humanity, and this is the reason our species is both perfectible and corruptible."


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> The task of understanding the,n depends not on the extraction of an abstract set of principles, and still less on the application of a theoretical model, but rather on an encounter with the singular, the specific, and ·the inflividual

> , Herdet's brilliant vision of the mutual embeddedness of art and history underlies our fascination with the possibility of treating all of the written and visual traces of a particular culture as a mutually intelligible network of signs.


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> Like other crucial distinctions, the nature/culture divide should be read, in the manner of structural linguistics, as a key binary opposition, loaded with information for deciphering the various social codes one encounters in historicalstudies.


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> Still, the notion of .l distinct culture, particularly a culture distant in time or space, as a text-a notion we got more from Geertz and the structUralists than from the historicists-is powerfully attractive for several reasons. It carries the core hermeneutical. presumption that one can occupy a position from which one .. can discover meanings that those who left traces of themselves could not have articulated. Explication and paraphrase are not enough; we seek something more, something that the authors we study.wowd not have had sufficient distance upon themselves and their own era to grasp.


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> The notion of culture as text has a further major attraction: it v~ expands the range of objects available to be read and interpreted.


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> Others are texts that have been regarde~ as altogether nonliterary, that is, as lacking the aesthetic polish, the self-conscious use of rhetorical figures, the ::ura of distance from the everyday world, the marked status as fiction that separately or together characterize belles lettres

> New historicism helps raise questions about originality in art and about the status of "genius" as an explanatory term, along with the status of the distinction between "major" and "minor."

> orks of' art, inthe more perferVfd moirierii:s"of'cefeo!atiiin, are almost completely detached from semantic necessity and are instead deeply important as signs and · embodiments ofthe freedom ofthe human imagination. The rest o{human life can only gaze longingly at the condition of the art object, which is the manifestation of unalienated labor, the perfect articulation and realization of human energy. The art object, ideally self-enclosed, is freed not .only from the necessities of the surrounding wqrld (necessities that it transforms miraculously into play) but also from the intention ofthe maker.


  

<mark style="background-color:#f2c94c">Important / Interesting</mark>
> ut the new historicist project is not about "demoting" art or discrediting aesthetic pleasure; rather it is concerned with finding the creative power that shapes literary works outside the narrow boundaries in which it had hitherto been located, as well as within those boundaries.
