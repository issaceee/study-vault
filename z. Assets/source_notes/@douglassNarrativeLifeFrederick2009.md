# Notes  
%% begin notes %%

How does Douglass learn to read? Why did the enslavers in the US go to such great lengths to prevent the enslaved from learning to read? Does Douglass learn anything else, aside from reading, as he learns how to read? (If that makes sense as a question.)

Douglass' first foray into literacy was with Sophia's lessons about the alphabet. However, her husband forbids this, claiming “learning will unfit him to be a slave”. Douglass then trades bread to white boys for lessons, copies letters from scraps and copybooks, and studies *The Columbian Orator*.

Enslavers forbid literacy as it threatens the ideological and practical channels of slavery. Practically, learning to write allows for the enslaved to forge passes/contracts. However, more crucially, it allows them to learn independently. It exposes the fraud of pro-slavery theology, allowing them to learn of their situation. This is where Douglass faces a crisis of misery as he now knows his condition. This later transforms into purpose and an ungovernable mind, with reading therefore becoming training in argument and self-awareness, as well as a motivation for independence.

> While on their way, they would make the dense old woods, for miles around, reverberate with their wild songs, revealing at once the highest joy and the deepest sadness. They would compose and sing as they went along, consulting neither time nor tune. The thought that came up, came out—if not in the word, in the sound;—and as frequently in the one as in the other. They would sometimes sing the most pathetic sentiment in the most rapturous tone, and the most rapturous sentiment in the most pathetic tone. Into all of their songs they would manage to weave something of the Great House Farm. Especially would they do this, when leaving home.

Every tone was a testimony against slavery, and a prayer to God for deliverance from chains. The hearing of those wild notes always depressed my spirit, and filled me with ineffable sadness. I have frequently found myself in tears while hearing them. The mere recurrence to those songs, even now, afflicts me; and while I am writing these lines, an expression of feeling has already found its way down my cheek. To those songs I trace my first glimmering conception of the dehumanizing character of slavery. I can never get rid of that conception. Those songs still follow me, to deepen my hatred of slavery, and quicken my sympathies for my brethren in bonds. If any one wishes to be impressed with the soul-killing effects of slavery, let him go to Colonel Lloyd’s plantation, and, on allowance-day, place himself in the deep pine woods, and there let him, in silence, analyze the sounds that shall pass through the chambers of his soul,—and if he is not thus impressed, it will only be because “there is no flesh in his obdurate heart.
