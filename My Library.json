  {"id":"baymMelvillesQuarrelFiction1979","abstract":"Herman Melville began his literary career as the author of popular, presumably ephemeral works. He employed fiction for its entertainment value and, though he was a storyteller of genius, had no respect for the fictional mode. His view of authorship changed and his ambitions expanded over time, but his basic distrust of, and lack of interest in, fiction remained constant—may even have grown stronger—in his works. He accepted an Emersonian view of fiction as an impediment to the direct utterance of truth and found the requirements of fiction—story, character, point of view—a limitation and a distortion of the absolute expression for which he strove. Melville’s impatience with, and lack of regard for, the mode of fiction can be traced through his works from 1846 to 1857, after which he ceased to write for a large public.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Baym","given":"Nina"}],"citation-key":"baymMelvillesQuarrelFiction1979","container-title":"PMLA/Publications of the Modern Language Association of America","container-title-short":"Publ.

  {"id":"bryantRewritingMobyDickPolitics2010","abstract":"The study of textual evolution, or revision as a textual phenomenon, requires a form of fluid-text editing that not only gives readers access to the textual identities that constitute the versions of a work but also makes the revision process witnessable by generating revision sequences and revision narratives for every revision event. Traditional editorial approaches that mix versions in the editing of a work compromise the integrity of textual identities, and the problem of mixing versions is demonstrated in three examples of the way editors and critics (in the context of orientalist and colonialist discourses) have changed the text of, or rewritten, Herman Melville's\n              Moby-Dick\n              : Edward Said's mistaking John Huston and Ray Bradbury's film ending for Melville's, the British expurgations that modulate Queequeg's homosexuality to preclude the idea of homosexual domesticity and marriage, and the British editors' conversion of Queequeg's Christianity (and modern editors' perpetuation of the unwanted conversion). These historical and modern cases show that readers, sometimes despite themselves, revise texts materially in ways that mirror their desire and the ways of power. Editing the rewriting of a text like\n              Moby-Dick\n              in a digital critical archive would preserve all versions and generate revision narratives that textualize the otherwise invisible dynamics of revision in a culture. With its capacity to edit fluid texts, digital humanities scholarship is well situated to expand the discourse on the dynamics of textual evolution into the literary and cultural criticism of the twenty-first century.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Bryant","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"bryantRewritingMobyDickPolitics2010","container-title":"PMLA/Publications of the Modern Language Association of America","container-title-short":"Publ.

The dynamic of Eliot's novels involves the constant deviation of characters away fromtypes and toward fictional particularity, and it thereforematches a more general turn in British culture away froma desire for salvation conceived of as spiritual or ideational transcendence and toward a longing to attain a state of immanent existence that escapes the requirements of “meaning.”","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Gallagher","given":"Catherine"}],"citation-key":"gallagherGeorgeEliotImmanent2005","container-title":"Representations","DOI":"10.1525/rep.2005.90.1.61","ISSN":"0734-6018, 1533-855X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"61–74","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"George Eliot: Immanent Victorian","title-short":"George Eliot","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://online.ucpress.edu/representations/article/90/1/61/67265/George-Eliot-Immanent-Victorian","volume":"90"},

In doing so, Poe not only participates in the early development of science fiction but also explores emerging relationships between scientific and literary discourses during the nineteenth-century print revolution, which made it difficult to distinguish between fictions and facts. “Hans Pfaall” selfconsciously dramatizes through stylistic turbulence how knowledge is generically produced within unruly media ecologies and is thus epistemologically unstable. In this sense, the story—not in spite but precisely because of its generic and aesthetic inconsistencies—can be regarded less as an unsuccessful hoax and more as a narrative about the dynamics of writing and reading fiction under conditions of doubt.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",11,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Maurice S."}],"citation-key":"leeGenreScienceHans2019","container-author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Maurice S."}],"container-title":"The Oxford Handbook of Edgar Allan Poe","DOI":"10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190641870.013.20","editor":[{"family":"Kennedy","given":"J.

Central concerns about human nature and just how civilized Victorians really were, were allied to concerns about the future of the ‘white race’ and its continued social and political hegemony. Much of the literature of this time focuses on the erosion of the boundaries between things that had seemed self-evident to earlier generations (racial distinctiveness, class superiority, imperialism and so on). Through anthropological themes, the Sherlock Holmes stories of Arthur Conan Doyle reinforced all that was seen as good in the imperial project and in the hereditary superiority of those who delivered it. Yet after 1901 and The Hound of the Baskervilles these anthropological tropes all but vanished from Doyle’s work.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",11,1]]},"author":[{"family":"McNabb","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"mcnabbAnthropologyGaslightSherlock2017","container-title":"World Archaeology","container-title-short":"World Archaeology","DOI":"10.1080/00438243.2017.1406396","ISSN":"0043-8243, 1470-1375","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",10,20]]},"language":"en","page":"728–751","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Anthropology by gaslight: Sherlock Holmes, Conan Doyle and the anthropology of detection at the Victorian <i>fin de siècle</i>","title-short":"Anthropology by gaslight","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00438243.2017.1406396","volume":"49"},

Claire Lees’s and Gillian Overing’s argument for approaches that emphasize continuity between Anglo-Saxon England and the later medieval period prompted the author to ask these questions: What themes and images of virginity and chastity from Anglo-Saxon writings were present in 14th- and 15th- century England? Where did Anglo-Saxon writers such as Aldhelm and Ælfric get their ideas of virginity and chastity and were they different from earlier conceptions?

  {"id":"northLiteraryCriticismConcise2017","abstract":"Literary Criticism offers a concise overview of literary studies in the English-speaking world from the early twentieth century to the present. Joseph North steps back from the usual tangle of figures, schools, and movements in order to analyze the intellectual paradigms that underpinned them. The result is a radically new account of the discipline's development, together with a trenchant argument about where its political future lies. People in today's literature departments often assume that their work is politically progressive, especially when compared with the work of early- and mid-twentieth-century critics. North's view is less cheering. For when understood in relation to the longer arc of the discipline, the current historicist and contextualist mode in literary studies represents a step to the Right. Since the global turn to neoliberalism in the late 1970s, all the major movements within literary studies have been diagnostic rather than interventionist in character: scholars have developed sophisticated techniques for analyzing culture, but they have retreated from systematic attempts to transform it. In this respect, the political potential of current literary scholarship compares poorly with that of earlier critical modes, which, for all their faults, at least had a programmatic commitment to cultural change. Yet neoliberalism is now in crisis--a crisis that presents opportunities as well as dangers. North argues that the creation of a genuinely interventionist criticism is one of the central tasks facing those on the Left of the discipline today","author":[{"family":"North","given":"Joseph"}],"citation-key":"northLiteraryCriticismConcise2017","event-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","ISBN":"978-0-674-96773-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Harvard university press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","source":"BnF ISBN","title":"Literary criticism: a concise political history","title-short":"Literary criticism","type":"book"},

As I show, Eliot’s formal innovations display a persistent concern, allied with contemporary studies of perception, with visual limitation as the defining quality of character reality. Eliot, I argue, creates a distinctly phenomenal realism by suggesting aesthetic reality to be something we designate and engage with through phenomenal as opposed to access consciousness. In this way, I also develop a new account of realist ethics: figuring limitation as the condition of both reality-perception and agency in the realization of self as contingent part.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Star","given":"Summer J."}],"citation-key":"starFeelingRealMiddlemarch2013","container-title":"ELH","container-title-short":"elh","DOI":"10.1353/elh.2013.0030","ISSN":"1080-6547","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",9]]},"language":"en","page":"839–869","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Feeling Real in Middlemarch","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://muse.jhu.edu/article/520495","volume":"80"},

  {"id":"syHansPfaallsBreath2024","abstract":"This essay examines the connections between Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall” and the scientific and political discourse of antebellum America, particularly insofar as it centered on atmospheric science. This essay argues that Poe’s story should be read within an antebellum comprehension of atmospheric science that used the atmosphere as a metaphor to comment on freedom, revolution, and slavery. I read Hans’s journey through the atmosphere as a thought experiment addressing the contemporary scientific challenge of measuring the upper atmosphere, while also engaging with the era’s scientific literature, notably the work of the French astronomer Benjamin Valz. Furthermore, the essay examines the story’s engagement with racial determinism and its commentary on human liberty. I suggest that Hans’s interaction with the atmosphere both figuratively and literally reflects upon contemporaneous ruminations about race and bondage. By placing “Hans Pfaall” amidst the scientific discourse on atmospheric and astronomical sciences and examining its political and intellectual underpinnings, the essay contributes to the understanding of Poe’s work within the broader context of nineteenth-century science and its metaphorical use in literature to address questions of human liberty and knowledge.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",11,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Sy","given":"Lloyd Alimboyao"}],"citation-key":"syHansPfaallsBreath2024","container-title":"Poe Studies","container-title-short":"poe","DOI":"10.1353/poe.2024.a939002","ISSN":"1754-6095","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"en","page":"129–152","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Hans Pfaall's Breath: Edgar Allan Poe and Antebellum Atmospheres","title-short":"Hans Pfaall's Breath","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://muse.jhu.edu/article/939002","volume":"57"},
